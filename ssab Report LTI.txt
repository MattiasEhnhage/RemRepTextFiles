  Voestalpine.Application of performance criteria
The performance criteria for the CEO’s variable 
remuneration have been selected to deliver the 
company’s strategy and to encourage behavior 
which is in the long-term interest of the company. 
In the selection of performance criteria, the 
strategic objectives and short-term and long-term 
business priorities have been taken into account. 
The non-financial performance criteria further 
contribute to alignment with sustainability as well 
as the company values. ABOUT SSAB REPORTS
