Long-term incentives: 
2024 NKT Performance Share 
Program awarded to ensure 
long-term retention*
During 2024, NKT continued the 
Performance Share Program, which 
was first introduced during 2018. 
The Performance Share Plan is 
structured as a conditional right for 
participants to receive shares after 
a three-year performance period at 
nil payment. For 2024, the performance share 
awards were made to selected indi -
viduals in line with the award level 
permitted under the policy. The per -
formance shares will vest subject to 
continuous service and the achieve -
ment of performance KPIs over 
three years as described below. 
As in 2023 it has been decided 
to focus on two key elements of 
business performance in the 2024 
program: 2026 year-end operational 
EBITDA to ensure a continuous 
focus on securing the projected 
earnings of the underlying business 
and TSR to ensure that executive 
management focuses on providing 
adequate value to shareholders, 
thereby se holders, 
thereby securing the long-term via -
bility of NKT.
