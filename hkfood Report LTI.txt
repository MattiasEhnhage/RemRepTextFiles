of shareholders, and enable the Company’s long-term 
successful performance.
All long-term incentive plans include the requirement 
of continuance of service upon award payment in order

CEO should retain at least 50% of all shares received as 
an award until the value of shareholding equals his/her 
annual base salaries during the validity of service.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2019–2021
The CEO Juha Ruohola was entitled to the LTI 2019–2021 
plan, which included both a Performance Share Plan and a Restricted Share Plan. The Performance Share Plan 
2019–2021 had one two-year performance period 
(2019–2020) and one one-year performance period 
(2021). The performance measure for the performance 
period 2019–2020 was cumulative cash flow from 
operating activities. The achievement level of this 
two-year period was 75%. The earning criterion for the 
performance period 2021 was EBIT. The criterion was not 
met and thus, there was no pay-out for this period.
