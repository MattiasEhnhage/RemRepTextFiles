 e LTI-bonus is three fiscal 
years.
The performance target for LTI 2022–2024, LTI 2023–2025 and LTI 
2024–2026 is development of earnings per share over a three-year 
period adjusted for the categories of adjustment items that the 
Board of Directors determines at the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee at the implementation of each program.
The incentive program LTI 2022–2024 expired at the end of the 
2024 fiscal year and the performance targets was not achieved, 
which resulted in that there is no bonus payout.
