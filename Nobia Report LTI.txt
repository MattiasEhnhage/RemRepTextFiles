Share based remuneration 
The annual general meeting 2024 and 2023 resolved to adopt long -term incent pt long -term incentive programs. However, 
Nobia did not implement the long-term incentive program in 2024 nor 2023 due to challenging 
market conditions and economic downturn . 
The CEO participated in the Nobia performance share plan (2022/2024). The performance share plan comprises approximately 80 employees consisting of senior executives and senior managers within Nobia. Participation in the 2022/2024 plan required an employee ’s private investment in Nobia shares 
between 5% and 10% of the annual base salary, depending on participant category. At the end of the vesting period, the participants will be allotted performance shares in Nobia free of charge, provided 
that the perform ance target related to average operating profit (EBIT) has been achieved. Allotment of 
the shares is subject to continuous employment throughout the vesting period. For the CEO, each 
saving share carries entitlement to a maximum of six share rights. The CEO invested 100% (i.e. 10% of 
the annual base  of 
the annual base salary) in the 2022/2024 plan in the role as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
corresponding to 9,199 savings shares and 55,194 share rights. 
See note 4 in the Annual and Sustainability Report 202 4 for further details about LTI programs.
