 accordance with the decision-making process defined in the Remuneration Policy. No temporary deviations from the Remuneration Policy were applied in 2024. 
Furthermore, the Board did not observe any circumstances or activities that would have resulted in a need to 
apply claw-back clauses applicable to the CEO’s variable remuneration in 2024. The Board also did not deem it 
necessary to use its right to adjust the performance criteria applied in 2024. In line with the Remuneration Policy, remuneration in 2024 has supported Evli’s business strategy with a 
focus on creating long-term growth and shareholder value. Although a significant part of the CEO’s and the 
Deputy CEO’s total remuneration is in the form of fixed payments, performance-based components are 
set to encourage the achievement of targets. Remuneration is balanced to avoid excessive risk-taking. The 
Compensation Committee has evaluated the CEO’s and the Deputy CEO’s remuneration for 2024 to ensure 
a competitive and fair an performance criteria are evaluated annually by the Board. The performance targets linked to 
the short-term incentive for the CEO and his deputy for 2024 are presented in the next table. The purpose of 
short-term incentives is to encourage the achievement of financial and other short-term objectives in line with 
the business strategy. The short-term incentive plan remuneration is dependent on the financial performance 
of Evli, as well as reaching strategic targets.

For the CEO, the short-term incentives earned in 2024 amounted to approximately 29 percent of the maximum

approximately 33 percent. In accordance with the regulations, the renumeration will be paid in installments: 50 
percent in spring 2025 and 50 percent in steps during the next three years. The delayed remuneration is linked

Long-term incentives in 2024
The existing long-term incentive plans for the CEO and his deputy have been implemented as performance 
share plans (PSP). The purpose of the share-based retention plans is to encourage the executives and the 
selected key employees to work on a long-term basis to increase shareholder value and to commit to the 
company. The Board decides a  performance criteria of the plan 
are tied to the operating profit of the company (EBIT). The potential rewards from the long-term incentive plans 
are deferred and paid in compliance with the legislation governing the financial sector. In addition, the payment 
of the rewards is followed by a retention period of one year, during which the shares paid out as a bonus cannot 
be transferred.
During 2024, no share-based incentives were paid to the CEO and the Deputy CEO.
