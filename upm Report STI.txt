The remuneration for the Directors and 
the CEO during the financial year 2024 was 
executed in accordance with the Policy. No 
temporary deviations from the Policy have 
been made and no remuneration of the CEO 
nor the Directors has been reclaimed or 
restated (clawback and malus provisions) 
during the financial year 2024.
The aim of the CEO’s remuneration is to 
drive and reward the achievement of the 
Company’s strategic priorities and thereby 
promote the Company’s long-term financial 
success, competitiveness and favorable 
development of shareholder value. The 
share ownership recommendation further 
strengthens the alignment of interests of 
the Company, the CEO and the Company’s 
shareholders. A significant portion of the 
CEO’s theoretical maximum total remu-
neration opportunity is based on variable 
components and the payout is dependent on 
the achievement of predetermined perfor-
mance measures. In the financial year 2024, 
the remuneration paid and c ating a close alignment of the Directors’ 
interests with those of shareholders.
The travel and lodging expenses in-
curred from meetings held elsewhere than in a Director’s place of residence were paid 
against invoice.
The Directors did not receive any meeting 
fees or other financial benefits for their 
Board or committee membership other than 
those stated in this Report.

3. Remuneration of the CEO
The remuneration of the CEO consists of 
fixed components, such as base salary 
and fringe benefits, variable components, 
such as short- and long-term incentives, 
pension and other financial benefits. Variable remuneration components form a 
significant portion of the theoretical maxi -
mum total remuneration opportunity, and 
the payout is dependent on the achieve -
ment of the predetermined performance measures that support the execution of 
the Company’s strategic priorities and 
promote the Company’s long-term value 
creation and fi ese 
can vary from year to year to align with the 
Company’s strategic priorities and usually 
include a balance of financial, strategic, 
operational, responsibility, safety, individual 
or other type of measures, provided that in 
any given year the majority of the measures 
will be based on financial criteria.
The short-term incentive payout for the 
Short-term Incentive Plan 2023 (STI 2023) 
in February 2024 was related to the CEO’s 
previous position within the Company as 
Executive Vice President of UPM Communi-
cation Papers and, therefore, not disclosed in 
the Report in further detail.
For the Short-term Incentive Plan 2024 
(STI 2024) the Board set two financial meas-
ures for the CEO, i.e. EBITDA and Operative 
Cash Flow. The weight of EBITDA measure 
accounted for 60% of all measures and the 
weight of Operative Cash Flow measure ac-
counted for 20% of all measures. In addition, 
the Board set also one strategic measure for 
the CEO (Leuna biochemicals refinery pro-
ject) a efinery pro-
ject) and the weight of this measure account-
ed for 20% of all measures. Set measures 
and target setting remained constant and 
unchanged throughout the financial year 
2024. The Board evaluated the performance 
against the set measures and targets for short-term incentive and did not exercise its 
right for discretion for short-term incentive 
plan payout. Short-term incentive payout 
was according to the formulaic outcome. 
Total achievement for the whole short-term 
incentive was 18.3% of the defined maxi-
mum annual short-term incentive payout 
opportunity and overall cap of 150% of the 
annual base salary. STI 2024 payout, based 
on 2024 performance, was paid in February 
2025.
