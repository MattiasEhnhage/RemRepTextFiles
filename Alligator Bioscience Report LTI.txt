 s resolved to implement 
a long-term incentive program by way of a performance-based 
share saving program for employees in Alligator (“ LTI 2021 ”), 
which was completed in 2024. In December 2024, a total of 
170,681 matching shares (the equivalent number of ordinary 
shares) were delivered to the 31 participants in LTI 2021, 
whereof 22,650 ordinary shares were delivered to CEO Søren 
Bregenholt. The total dilution effect of LTI 2021 thus amounted 
to 0.02 per cent of Alligator’s ordinary shares as of 31 December 
2024. The share price target included in LTI 2021 was not met, 
hence no performance shares were delivered to the participants 
in LTI 2021. 
In table 2 above, the CEO’s participation in LTI 2021 is presented.Table 2 – Share based incentive program, share saving program (CEO)
