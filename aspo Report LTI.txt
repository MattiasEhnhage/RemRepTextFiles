 for 2023– 
2025. The share-based incentive plan consists of three earnings periods, with the earned reward being based on the 
Group’s earnings per share (EPS, weight value 80%) and two sustainability indicators (emission intensity and accident 
frequency, weight value 20%). Participation in the plan and obtaining rewards require that the CEO allocates the freely 
transferable company shares he holds to the plan or acquires the company’s shares up to the quantity determined by 
the Board of Directors.
The potential reward will be paid partly in the company’s shares and partly in cash in 2024, 2025 and 2026. The 
cash proportion is intended to cover taxes and tax-related levies arising from the reward. As a rule, no reward will be 
paid if the CEO’s employment or service ends before the reward payment. In accordance with the Board of Directors’ 
decision (section 9), this incentive plan will end with the new long-term share-based incentive plan 2025–2027. 8.2. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
