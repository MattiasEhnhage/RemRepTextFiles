 ly between these countries. To ensure the 
alignment of the interests of the CEO and the shareholders, 
a significant portion of the CEO’s total remuneration 
opportunity is attributed to variable components, 
particularly long-term incentive plans. In contrast, employee 
remuneration is less volatile, with a smaller portion of total 
remuneration consisting of variable remuneration.
The Board members do not participate in any incentive plans 
and thus the remuneration of the Board is more stable in 
nature. 
The table sets out the remuneration paid during the 
respective year, considering that a portion of that 
remuneration may have been earned during the previous year.
Over the past 5-year period, the CEO’s actual paid 
remuneration is well aligned with the Company’s performance 
development as visualized in the table and graphs. Kemira 
has placed increased focus on profitable growth since 2020. 
Over the long-term Kemira has become a fundamentally 
stronger company following numer its, defined contribution pension, short- and long-term incentives as applicable for the period and position.
