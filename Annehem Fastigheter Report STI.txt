report.The company’s remuneration stru ’s remuneration structure
The current remuneration guidelines were 
adopted at the Annual General Meeting on 19 
May 2021. A prerequisite for the successful 
implementation of the company's business 
strategy and the safeguarding of its long-term 
interests, including its sustainability, is that the 
company can recruit and retain qualified 
employees. This requires that the company can 
offer competitive remuneration. The 
remuneration of senior executives is market-
based and consists of the following components: 
fixed cash salary, variable cash remuneration, 
pension benefits and other benefits. The variable 
cash remuneration is linked to predetermined and 
measurable criteria that are financial and non-
financial. The criteria are designed to promote the 
company's business strategy and long-term 
interests, including its sustainability, by, for 
example, having a clear connection to the 
business strategy or promoting the long-term 
development of the executive. New remuneration reholders’ meetingApplication of performance criteria 
Application of performance criteria 
The performance criteria for the CEO’s variable 
remuneration have been selected to deliver on 
the company’s strategy and to encourage 
behaviour that is in the long-term interests of 
the company. In the selection of performance 
criteria, the strategic objectives and short-term 
and long-term business priorities for 2024 have 
been taken into account. Further more, the non-
financial performance criteria contribute to 
adapting to sustainability issues and the
