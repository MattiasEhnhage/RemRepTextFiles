1 January 202 4 to 31 December 202 6 (the “Performance Period”), shares are allocated to

if the share price at the end of the program exceeds 200 percent of the share price at the start of the program.

Short -term variable cash compensation 
 
Background 
The Company has a short -term incentive plan for Betsson’s senior executives within the group as 
determined by the Board. 
Application of performance criteria 
The variable cash remuneration for 2024 was based on quarterly targets for revenue and operating 
income (EBIT) as determined by the Board. To ensure delivery on both measures, the plan pay -
out is based on the lower achievement of the two (e.g., if revenue performance is at 107 percent 
and EBIT at 96 percent, the pay -out will follow EBIT performance at 96 percent). An achieved 
quarterly bonus is paid out with six months delay, provided that the participant in the program remains employed within the group at the time of pay -out. This means that the bonus is paid d y bonus
