 Remuneration to the CEO 
Despite the decline in net revenue of 8% for the financial year 2023, with an incurred adjusted EBIT loss of SEK 85 m illion, the board considered it prudent to reward the new and former 
CEO a bonus for making successful contributions to the Company’s progress in materially improving the gross margin of the Company as well  the Company as well as managing the Company’s net working capital to protect the overall cash situation during a very unpredictable market situation.
