Share -related and share price -related remuneration 
Since 2019, t he company has annually implemented a long -term incentive program (“LTIP”) based on performance shares. These programs are aimed 
at members of the executive management and key personnel . The company currently has three outstanding incentive programs : LTIP 202 2, LTIP 
2023 and LTIP 202 4. Performance shares refer to ordinary shares in the company. Vesting of performance shares presupposes continued employment 
and is subject to a three -year qualification period. Vesting of performance shares also presupposes fulfilment of performance conditions that are  conditions that are based 
on earnings per share for the company and, as far as LTIP 2024 is concerned, also the company’s CO 2 equivalent emission level . Allotment of 
performance shares shall take place free of charge and is subject to income taxation. For further information, s ee Table 2 and Table 3b below . 
 
Share -related and share price -related incentive programs completed during 202 4 
The company’s long -term incentive program 202 1 (“LTIP 202 1”) was completed during the financial year 202 4. Allotment of performance shares within 
LTIP 202 1 required that the performance target linked to the company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) for the financial year 202 3 were fulfilled. The EPS 
for the financial year 202 3 that was used for this purpose was derived directly from the EPS value stated in the annual report for the financial year 
2023 as established and approved by the annual general meeting. The number of shares used in the calculation of EPS was the number of outstand d pension. The variable share includes variable and extraordinary remuneration, as well as (if applicable) pension paid on a variable remuneration.
