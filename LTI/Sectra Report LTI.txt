guidelines, the company’s Annual General Meeting has resolved on the introduction of long-term share-based incentive 
programs. 
In accordance with the guidelines, the terms and conditions must emphasize remu neration after performance, and vary 
in relation to the individual’s performance and the Group’s earnings. Remuneration to senior executives is to be on 
market terms and can consist of the following components : fixed cash salary, variable cash remuneration, pension 
benefits and other benefits. Variable cash remuneration is to be based on predetermined and measurable criteria. These criteria should be based on: 
(i) financial earnings (profit, financial efficiency and sales) or alternately operational goals that over the long term are 
felt to lead to solid financial results; 
(ii) share-based goals; and 
(iii) non-financia were taken into account in the 
selection of performance criteria. The non-financial performance criteria also contribute to the adaptation to sustainability as well as the company’s values. All perform ance criteria have been met for 2023/2024 and 2022/2023.
