of its long- term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company can recruit and retain qualified 
personnel. To this end, it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. Beijer Ref’s remuneration guidelines and long -term share -based incentive program enable the company to offer 
the CEO a competitive total remuneration.

variables: net profit growth, net sales growth, improvement of invento provement of inventory turnover rate, acquisitions and
