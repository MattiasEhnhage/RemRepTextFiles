 individual performance and 
responsibility of the members of the EMB in relation to established financial and non -financial targets, both in short and 
longer term, and (ii) the Company’s overall performance. 
The composition of the remuneration is determined with a view to contribute to the Company’s ability to attract and retain 
competent key employees, while at the same time ensuring that the EMB member has an incentive to create added value for 
the benefit of the Company's shareholders through variable remuneration. 
The EMB’s terms of employment and remuneration are agreed between the individual EMB member and the Board. 
Total remuneration showed an increase compared to prior year. This was primarily driven by our improved earnings and 
positive achievement of certain KPIs, leading to pay-outs under short -term cash bonus plan for the Executive Management 
Board. In total, four out of five KPIs were met in the financial year 2023/24 .

Short -term cash b onus plan 
Individual members of the EMB may receive an annual cash bonus determined at the discretion of the Board. The annual cash 
bonus is intended to align individual members’ interests with the Company’s short -term targets. Payment of the cash bonus 
thus depends on the achievement of objectives related to the achievement of the Company’s budgeted results, financial ratios 
and other measurable personal results of a financial or non­financial nature, all of which reflect and support the Company’s 
short -term objectives as further described in table 5 below . 
The size of the bonus may not exceed 100% of the CEO’s and 45.5% of additional members' annual gross salary.
