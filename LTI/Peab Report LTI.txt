Allocation of performance shares is contingent on achievement of the target levels set by 
the Board for the financial years 2024 -2026 regarding earnings per share (EPS) according to 
segment reporting and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. If the minimum level in the 
interval for performan ce target EPS is not achieved the share rights do not entitle allocation 
of performance shares while every share right entitles to (1) one performance share if the 
maximum level is achieved. Performance shares are allocated linearly between the minimum 
and maximum levels. The performance target of reduced carbon dioxide emissions requires 
that a predetermined reduction must be achieved.
