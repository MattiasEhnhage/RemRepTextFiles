performance year.

Lindab International AB . 
[3] The change in total remuneration relates to the annual change in the sum of all remuneration components as reported in Table

from 1 April 2020 to 31 August 2020, the CEO voluntarily sacrificed part of his gross salary owing to Covid- 19. 
[5] The annual change in total remuneration is attributable to salary review, as well as a higher level of variable cash remuneration,
