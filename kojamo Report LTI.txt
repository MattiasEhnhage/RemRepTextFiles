Remuneration Report 2024 6 
commitment to the implementation of the Company’s strategy and offer the CEO a competi-
tive incentive plan based on the earning and accumulation of the Company’s shares. 
The Board of Directors decides the performance criteria for each earning period and the tar-
gets for each criterion as well as the earning opportunity in cash and/or the number of Kojamo 
shares before the start of each earning period. The duration of the ea rning periods in the in-
centive plans currently in effect is three years each. 
With the help of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors assesses the achieve-
ment of the performance criteria of long -term remuneration based on the Company’s financial 
 ompany’s financial 
statements figures at the start of each earning period relative to the confi rmed target matrices. The grounds for determining remuneration under the long -term incentive plans currently in ef-
fect and the degree to which the criteria were achieved are shown in the table below. 
Any reward for each earning period will be paid during the year following the expiry of the 
earning period partially in shares in the Company and partially in cash. The cash component 
is intended to cover taxes and similar fees incurred by the CEO as a res ult of the reward. 
The CEO must hold 50 per cent of the net number of shares paid to him based on the whole 
incentive plan, until his/her total shareholding in the Company corresponds to the value of 
his/her annual gross salary. Such number of shares must be held as long as the CEO’s em-
ployment or service relationship with the Company continues .
