 Total remuneration CEO
Comment on the development for 2024 
The table above shows the CEO and average 
employee remuneration, along with the Group’s 
 financial performance development from 2020 to 
2024. As can be seen, compared to the average 
employee remuneration, there is a higher variance 
in the CEO’s remuneration, as it is more influenced by variable components that depend on SKF’s 
 financial performance.
In 2024, the SKF financial performance is strong, 
though slightly softer compared to the previous year. 
This is reflected in the lower CEO remuneration for 
2024 compared to last year.

(Performance Share Programme)
Since 2008 the Annual General Meeting has resolved 
each year upon a multi-year variable renumeration 
programme, the SKF Performance Share Programme 
(PSP) for senior managers and key employees. The 
performance criteria used to assess the outcome for 
each of the currently running programmes are distinctively linked to the business strategy and,
thereby, to the SKF Group’s long-term value creation, 
including its sustainability.

 Performance Share Programmes, please see below.
