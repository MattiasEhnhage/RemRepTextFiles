 mes.The plans are clearly linked to the business strategy and the Company’s long-term value creation by being linked to earnings development. 
Variable cash remuneration 
Variable cash remuneration is linked to predetermined and measur-able criteria with a clear connection to the company’s financial targets. The outcome is linked to the fulfilment of established goals concerning the Group’s profit before taxes and working capital efficiency for per-sons in Group roles. For business area managers, the outcome is linked 
to the relevant business area’s EBITA result and working capital effi-
ciency. The Board of Directors is responsible for making that assess-ment as regards the CEO. For the other members of the Group man-agement team, the CEO makes the assessment. The outcome for the 2024 financial year amounts to 28% (97) of the maximum outcome 
for the CEO and 38% (82) as an average for others in the Group 
management team. Outstanding share and share price-related 
incentive programme 
incentive programmes The main purpose of long-term incentive programmes is to create additional incentives for increased commitment and higher perfor-
mance among the participants, to strengthen the opportunities to 
recruit and retain key people and to create a common ownership interest between the participants and the shareholders. 
At the end of 2024, Indutrade had three outstanding long-term 
incentive programmes for senior executives and key personnel: 
the performance-based share programmes LTIP 2022, LTIP 2023 and 
LTIP 2024. LTIP 2021 was concluded in May 2024. 
LTIP 2021, LTIP 2022, LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024 
LTIP 2022, LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024 are performance-based share pro-
grammes for senior executives (including the CEO) and key personnel. 
Participation requires personal investment in Indutrade shares. These are referred to as Investment shares. For every Investment share acquired, a number of performance share rights were allotted, each of which, at the end of a three-yea e end of a three-year vesting period, can give the holder 
the right to receive up to one Indutrade share. In order to be allocated 
those shares, the employee must remain in employment, the Invest-ment shares must still be held and the performance requirements of the particular programme must be met. 
The performance conditions for LTIP 2021 were met in full and led 
to 356,169 Indutrade shares being distributed to programme partici-
pants, the CEO receiving 19,775 shares. 
The performance condition for LTIP 2022 is linked to the accumu-
lated earnings per share (EPS) for the Indutrade share during the per-formance period 2022–2024. The maximum value of the performance 
shares that can be allotted for each performance share right is limited 
to SEK 418 (corresponding to 200% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Indutrade share during 17–23 February 2022). 
The performance condition for LTIP 2023 is linked to the accumu-
lated earnings per share (EPS) for the Indutrade sha s respectively which, after the relevant programme period has ended, may entitle him to receive the same number of Indutrade shares. 
In connection with the launch of the performance-based share 
programmes, the Board also adopted a policy for senior executives’ 
share ownership. The recommended share ownership over time in relation to fixed annual salary is 100% for the CEO and 50% for other members of the Group management team.
