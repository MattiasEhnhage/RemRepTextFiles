 s 
per share. The outcome of LTI 2023/2025 is based 
on the development of Securitas’ operating margin. 
LTI 2024/2026 is based on both the development 
of Securitas’ operating margin and the reduction of 
Securitas’ greenhouse gas emissions. The LTI Programs 
are conditional upon the participant’s own investment 
and holding periods of several years. For every Securitas 
series B share purchased or nominated within the 
scope of the LTI Programs, the company will grant so 
called performance awards free of charge. The number 
of performance awards that will entitle participants 
to receive series B shares in the company depends 
on the fulfilment of the performance conditions 
in each LTI Program, compared to minimum and 
maximum target levels as defined by the Board of Directors, during the measurement period (a three- 
year period, January 1 year 1–December 31 year 3, for 
each of the programs). The outcome of LTI 2021/2023 
and LTI 2022/2024 is calculated yearly, whereby one 
third , whereby one 
third of the performance awards is measured against 
the outcome for the first year, one third is measured 
against the outcome for the second year and one third 
is measured against the outcome for the third year. 
The outcome of LTI 2023/2025 and LTI 2024/2026 is 
based on a three-year measurement period. If the 
minimum level is not reached for each performance 
condition, each performance award will entitle 
participants to receive zero series B shares, whereas if 
the maximum level is reached, each perfor mance award 
will entitle participants to receive one series B share. 
If the outcome falls between the minimum level and 
the maximum level, participants’ entitlement to series B 
shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one 
series B share per performance award.
The participants are divided in three categories and 
will be granted five (President and CEO), four (Group 
Management) or three (other participants) performance 
awards for each nominated sha r each nominated share. The LTI Programs have 
been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore 
excluded from the remuneration guidelines. 
More information on Securitas’ incentive plans is available 
on Securitas’ website securitas.com, section Corporate 
Governance – Remuneration to Group Management.Under LTI 2021/2023 and LTI 2022/2024, the President 
and CEO has received performance awards, with the 
corresponding maximum number of series B shares 
detailed in Table 2. For LTI 2023/2025 and LTI 2024/2026, 
the President and CEO has received performance awards, 
with the corresponding maximum number of series B 
shares, detailed in Table 3.
Following the rights issue that was completed in 
October 2022, a re calculation of the maximum number 
of performance awards under LTI 2021/2023 and 
LTI 2022/2024 has been carried out in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the LTI Programs. The below 
tables set out the number series B shares awarded/vested 
etc. as applicable,  etc. as applicable, on the basis of the fulfilment of the 
performance conditions.
APPLICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
Short -term as well as long -term incentives for the 
President and CEO include clearly measurable 
performance- based targets that aim for long -term 
profitability of the Group. The performance targets that 
are required to achieve maximum bonus are based 
on development of real change in earnings per share 
adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating 
margin and reduction of Securitas’ greenhouse 
gas emissions.2

1 Following the Rights Issue a recalculation was carried out with a factor of 1.2025814 for the maximum potential of B shares that can be allocated. A corresponding reduction in the grant date value for each share leaves the cost for the company unchanged. 
Under LTI 2022/2024 a maximum of 50 256 shares can be awarded per year 2022, 2023 and 2024 or in total 150 767 shares. The fair value according to IFRS 2 was determined on May 10, 2022, at SEK 84.57 per share. During 2024 the award was for 50 256 shares.
