The remuneration structure aims to reinforce and support expansion and growth of the company. The incentive 
plans for the CEO and Group Executive Management are based on key value drivers for the respective 
businesses and the Group overall. With clear targets for both short-term and long-term incentives covering 
financial, strategic and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities, the Board of Directors aims to 
support sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. A significant proportion of the CEO’s remuneration is derived from variable pay, comprising both short-term and 
long-term incentives, and is described in more detail below. The Board of Directors aims to ensure that the 
remuneration is well aligned with the financial performance of the company and execution of the strategy, which 
is particularly important in times of significant ongoing renewal.
