support the achievement of the Company’s strategy and financial targets.

General Meeting based on the proposal of the Shareholders’ Nomination 
Board. The remuneration for the Chair, Vice Chair, and members of the 
Board and its committees for the period of 2024–2025 was approved by the 
2024 AGM.

on the evaluation and proposal by the Board’s People and Culture 
Committee, and the Company’s Remuneration Policy. The total

the appointment of the CEO, have been duly listed as possible deviations 
from the Policy. As of 2026, the CEO’s STI programme will fully align with the
