3 Application of performance criteria 
The CEO’s variable remuneration is based on a number of pre -determined and measurable 
criteria and goals on an annual basis, aimed at driving long -term value creation in the Company. 
Fulfilment of one of the criteria is a threshold requirement (so -called “qualifier”) and is a 
prerequisite for payment of variable remuneration. To reinforce the C ompany’s pay -for-
performance philosophy, the STIP23 was designed to reward and recognize executives for 
beating the most important annual financial targets as set in the budget. 
 The table below sets out the application of performance criteria for payment of variable 
remuneration during the financial year , where the incentive program has provided for up to 
40% of fixed annual salary (see further section “ The Company’s remuneration guidelines: 
scope, purpose and deviations ”).
