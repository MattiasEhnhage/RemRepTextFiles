Chair’s foreword
Dear Shareholder,
The year 2024 marked the start of a new era for Valmet. In 
August, we welcomed new President and CEO Thomas 
Hinnerskov, who has had a strong start by meeting as many 
Valmeteers, customers, and other stakeholders as possible 
to l Remuneration Policy was approved at the 
Annual General Meeting held in March 2024. Based on the 
Policy’s guidance, the Remuneration and HR Committee and 
the Board of Directors will actively continue to ensure Valmet 
has a strong set of long- and short-term incentives that drive 
business performance, motivate and engage key personnel, 
support strategy implementation, and meet shareholder 
expectations.In 2024, we decided to modify our long-term incentive program 
and continue with only one long-term incentive plan, the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP), for the upcoming plan period. 
The PSP is for the Executive Team, including the President 
and CEO, and a limited group of nominated key personnel 
and management talents. The PSP includes both strategic 
and financial performance measures and has a three-year 
performance period to support the Company in achieving its 
strategic targets, while aligning the interests of management 
and our shareholders. The plan also includes a signifi homas such a warm welcome to the team. We are on a journey 
together, and I look forward to seeing what the coming years 
will bring.Mikael Mäkinen 
Chair of the Board of Directors

for the previous financial year
The Shareholder’s Nomination Board reviews benchmark data for board remuneration annually 
to determine the correct market compensation levels for the Chair of the Board, the Vice-Chair of 
the Board, and the members of the Board. 
In line with our remuneration policy, the compensation for the Board of Directors was adjusted, 
based on the Nomination Board’s 2024 proposal. Based on the decision of the Annual General 
Meeting, 40 percent of the Board’s annual fees were reinvested to buy Valmet shares from the 
market. No special terms or conditions are associated with share ownership.Board of Directors’ compensation in 2024 (in EUR)
