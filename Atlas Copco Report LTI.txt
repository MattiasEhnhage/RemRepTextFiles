Outstanding share and share -price related incentive programs 
In 2017 –2023, the Annual General Meeting decided on performance -based employee stock 
option plans based on a proposal from the Board for the respective years. The terms and 
conditions of these plans are in all material aspects similar to the terms and conditions of th e 
performance -based employee stock option plan for 202 4 in Atlas Copco Group, as described 
below. The performance criteria of the performance -based employee stock option plan which 
expired in 2024 was met at the level of 100%. 
 
At the Annual General Meeting 202 4, it was decided to implement a performance -based 
employee stock option plan for 202 4, which is similar in structure to the previous stock option 
plans approved by the Annual General Meeting. The plan is directed at a maximum 500 key 
employees in Atlas Copco Group who will have the possibility to acquire a maximum of 7 909 
235 series A shares in Atlas Copco AB. The  Atlas Copco AB. The allotment of options is dependent on the value 
increase of the Group, measured as Economic Value Added (EVA, d efined as the sum of 
adjusted operating profit and interest income less tax expenses and cost of capital) during 
2024. In an interval of SEK 5 500 000 000 the allotment varies linear from zero to 100% of the 
maximum number of options. Participation in the plan is based on position, qualifications and 
individual performance and the nominated employees are divided into four categories, with

different amounts of maximum allotment of options. The size of the plan and the limits of the 
interval have been established by the Board and have been approved by the Annual General 
Meeting and are compatible with the long -term busin the long -term business plan of the Group. 
 
In connection to the allotment , which will take place no later than March 20, 202 5, the exercise 
price shall be set to an amount corresponding to 110% of the average of the closing rates on 
Nasdaq Stockholm of Atlas Copco AB series A shares during a period of ten business days next 
following the date of the publishing of the full -year summary for 202 4. Hence, there is no 
economic value for the key employees unless the shareholder value increases during the 
vesting period. The options are not transferable and they remain the property of the employee 
only to the extent that they are exercisable at the ti me employment is terminated. The term of 
the options shall be seven years and the options are exercisable earliest three years from 
granting. Exercise is only possible when the market pr ice of the Atlas Copco AB series A share 
is higher than the exercise price thus promoting a focus on the Group’s sustained growth. A 
single pay rowth. A 
single payment/assignment of shares under the plan can never exceed four times the value of 
the exercise price. 
 
Since the Board believes that it is of particular importance to the shareholders that Group 
Management and division president have a long -term interest in the good value development 
of the share of the company, there is a requirement regarding own investme nt. As a 
prerequisite for the full participation in the performance -based employee stock option plan 
2024, Group Management and division presidents have to invest 10% of their respective base 
salary for 202 4 (20% for expatriates with net salary), before ta x, in Atlas Copco AB series A 
shares. A lower amount of investment will reduce the number of performance stock options 
proportionately. Further, Group Management and division presidents who have chosen to 
invest in Atlas Copco AB series A shares will get, in addition to the proportional participation 
in the plan, allocation of matching options, c  matching options, correspond ing to the number of shares acquired 
under 202 4. The matching options can be redeemed no earlier than three years after granting , 
at an exercise price that corresponds to 75% of the average of the closing rates of Atlas Copco 
AB series A shares during a period of ten business days next following the date of the 
publishing of the full -year summary for 202 4, subject to continued employment and continued 
ownership of the shares. If the number of acquired shares has been reduced prior to the date 
when matching options become exercisable, the right to matching options is reduced on a 
share by share basis. 
 
The Board has the right to introduce an alternative incentive plan for key employees in such 
countries where the granting of stock options is not feasible. Such alternative incentive 
solutions shall, to the extent possible, have same terms and conditions c orresponding to the 
ones applicable to the performance -based stock option plan.
