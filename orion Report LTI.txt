 e President and CEO’s remuneration is based on variable incentives 
based on the achievement of objectives set by the Board of Directors for the earning periods of 
the short-term and share-based incentive plans. The length of these earning periods is one year 
for the short-term incentive plan and three years for the share-based incentive plans in force in 
2024. For the short-term incentive, the Board of Directors assesses and confirms the achievement 
of the objectives annually. For the long-term incentive, achievement is assessed at the end of 
each three-year earning period. Consequently, a significant portion of the President and CEO’s 
remuneration is determined based on the performance during the years preceding the payout.
The President and CEO’s short-term and share-based incentives are mainly based on Orion’s 
financial performance indicators. In 2024, the short-term incentive plan criteria were related to 
Orion’s profitability and net sales development, as well as personal nancial results. In 2024, the President and CEO’s 
remuneration increased, driven by strong variable pay outcomes in line with the Company’s 
performance. The ratio between the compensation paid to the President and CEO and the 
average Company employee increased over the past year. Additionally, the CEO transition in 
2022 has also influenced remuneration developments. As the Company navigates growth and 
industry dynamics, the remuneration structure ensures alignment between management 
incentives and long-term business success.
The table below presents the paid compensation for the last six years for the members of the 
Board of Directors, the President and CEO, and the average Orion employee. The fluctuation in 
the compensation of the President and CEO is driven by annual changes in short- and long-term 
incentive achievement linked to financial performance, the CEO transition implemented in 2022, 
and the supplementary pension plan established in 2024 to be market-aligned. The 
d otal compensation, and the fixed annual salary to 30%.The supplementary pension paid to the President and CEO corresponded to approximately 6% 
of total remuneration. Short-term incentives paid out in 2024 are based on the performance 
period corresponding to the calendar year 2023. Share-based incentives paid out in 2024 are 
based on the long-term incentive plan 2019, earning period 2021–2023. The President and CEO 
received no other financial benefits in 2024.
