 parate resolutions by the AGM. The guidelines for compensation to senior exec -
utives are available on Scandic’s website

In 2022, the Board resolved to pay the CEO a 
retention bonus, which is described in more detail below. For 2024, the recorded value of the retention bonus amounted to 3,944,496 SEK. This means that variable compensation for 2024 amounted to 132.5 percent of the fixed annual 
salary. As the guidelines for compensation to 
senior executives stipulate that variable cash compensation may not exceed 100 percent of the fixed annual salary, the CEO’s variable com -
pensation for 2024 deviates from the guidelines. COMPENSATION REPORT

Retention plan
In 2022, the Board resolved to pay the CEO vari -
able remuneration in the form of a retention 
bonus over a three-year period that will be paid 
to the CEO in 2025, provided he remains 
employed within the company. This was based 
on the Board’s assessment that it is business- 
critical for the company to ensure that the 
current CEO continues to lead Scandic during 
this period.
Share- ance shares, free of charge, 
depending on the degree of fulfillment of certain 
performance criteria determined by the Board 
related to the total return on the company’s 
shares (TSR). Performance shares will be allotted 
after the end of a vesting period until the date of 
publication of Scandic’s interim report for the first 
quarters of 2025, 2026 and 2027 respectively.
The current CEO has been allotted 146,325 
rights in the LTIP 2022, 181,083 rights in the LTIP 
2023 and 122,542 rights in the LTIP 2024. These 
have been allotted free of charge and are condi -
tional to three-year vesting periods and the 
CEO’s continued permanent employment in the 
company.Application of performance criteria
In 2024, a general short-term incentive program 
(STI) was launched with performance criteria 
linked to the company’s financial results, guest 
experience as well as leadership and commit -
ment. The criteria, target levels and assessment 
scales were prepared by the Compensation 
Committee
