 ary 7, 2024. The Remuneration Policy will be applied until it is next 
addressed at an Annual General Meeting.
The decision-making process concerning remunerations in 2024 has adhered to the decision-making process specified in the 
Remuneration Policy. The Board did not deviate temporarily from the Remuneration Policy in 2024. The Board did not observe 
conditions or activities that would have resulted in a need to apply the terms and conditions on reducing, cancelling or recovering the 
CEO’s variable remunerations in the 2024 financial period.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, the remuneration scheme has supported the shared long-term interests of the Company 
and its shareholders and promoted building a significant interest in the Company among the members of its bodies in order to 
incentivize and engage the members to act in accordance with the common goals.
A significant portion of the CEO’s total remuneration potential has been performance-based, and the Board has def nd the Board has defined the goals that 
serve as the pertinent payment criteria for the financial period based on the Company’s financial, operational and long-term strategic 
goals, including responsibility development, in such a way that they promote the Company’s business operations and long-term 
financial success. To promote share ownership, the CEO’s variable performance-based portion of the remuneration is determined as a 
quantity of Company shares, and the remuneration is paid after the end of the earnings period as a combination of shares and cash in 
such a way that the monetary amount corresponds with the taxes and parafiscal charges arising from the share reward. The earnings 
period for the CEO’s variable performance-based remuneration is the Company’s financial period. In accordance with the Remuneration 
Policy, the Board has monitored the fulfilment of the goals and the related indicators regularly.
In the 2024 financial period, the CEO had access to a variable perfor to a variable performance-based remuneration portion, for which the Board 
determined the earnings criteria in accordance with the aims described above. Due to the lagging financial development and the partial 
delay of strategic projects, the actual level of the variable performance-based remuneration for the 2024 financial period fell short of 
the targets. The remunerations paid to the CEO in the 2024 financial period, including the fixed salary and the variable performance-
based portion for the 2023 earnings period, totaled at EUR 212,515.
