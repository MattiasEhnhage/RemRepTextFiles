 s paid in 
2023. In 2023, profitability improved again thanks to the 
profit improvement program started in 2022, and thus the short-term incentives earned from 2023 and paid in 
the beginning of 2024 are on higher level.
The remuneration level of the Board of Directors was 
reviewed and determined to correspond to the market 
level by the decision of the AGM in 2020, 2022 and 2024. 
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 
remuneration of the CEO is strongly based on performance, 
and a significant share of the overall remuneration of the 
CEO consists of short-term and long-term incentives. The 
targets of the incentive schemes are directly linked to 
the Company performance. A CEO change took place at 
the end of 2019, and in 2020, remuneration of the CEO 
exceptionally only consisted of the base salary. In 2021, the 
CEO’s remuneration included short-term incentives for the 
year 2020. As a part of the Company’s mitigation measures 200

costs) by the average number of personnel.
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CEO’s short-term 
incentive earning opportunity was restricted to 50% of the 
normal level. In 2023, the overall compensation level was 
significantly impacted by the low outcome of short-term 
incentives from 2022. The total remuneration of the CEO 
for 2024 is again at a higher level, due to good financial 
development in 2023 and higher incentives paid in 2024. 
The CEO's base salary was also adjusted during 2024 to 
reflect the market level.
The average salary development of employees 
has shown a rising trend. Approximately 65% of the 
personnel is covered by collective agreements, and 
the general increases determined in the collective 
agreements mainly guide the salary development of this 
personnel group.
