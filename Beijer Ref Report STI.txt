Application of performance criteria for one -year variable remuneration 
A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company’s business strategy and safeguarding 
of its long- term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company can recruit and retain qualified 
personnel. To this end, it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. Beijer Ref’s remuneration guidelines and long -term share -based incentive program enable the company to offer 
the CEO a competitive total remuneration. 
The CEO may receive a maximum amount of variable cash remuneration equal to 100 per cent of annual salary. The performance measures for the CEO’s variable remuneration are based on five 
variables: net profit growth, net sales growth, improvement of invento provement of inventory turnover rate, acquisitions and
