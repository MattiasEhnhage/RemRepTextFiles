Incentive programme outcomes
The short-term incentive program (STIP) for the Group CEO 
successfully paid 103% of the target based on the results 
from 2024. This achievement stems from performance that 
exceeded financial targets, met individual objectives, but 
unfortunately fell short in some ESG (Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) areas. It is worth noting that the prerequisites for 
operating margin and free cash flow were met. 
Looking specifically at the CEO’s individual objectives, which 
account for 10% of the overall score, the Committee found 
that key goals such as strategy revision, regional performance, 
and identifying growth opportunities in general were achieved, 
resulting in a full pay-out (100%) for that element. For the 
Group CFO, the Committee assessed the individual objectives 
to have been achieved at 110% recognising that he landed well
