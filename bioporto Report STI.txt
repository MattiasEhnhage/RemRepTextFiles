the Company’s business strategy and sustainability, the 
Board of Directors deems it suitable to establish incentive-

of variable remuneration, including various share-based 
instruments such as share options, subscription rights

one-off or event-based. The extent to which a member of the Executive 
Management is covered by an incentive-based program 
and the specific agreement(s) that is/are actually concluded, 
including the size and composition of the remuneration 
granted, will depend on whether the Board of Directors 
deems it appropriate in order to establish common interests 
between the Executive Management and the shareholders 
and to take due account of the Company’s goals, including 
whether the specific remuneration supports the Company’s 
short-term or long-term goals. In addition, other factors 
influencing this will be the Executive Management’s 
previous and anticipated performa en (10) years from grant. The 
length of the vesting period is determined by the Board of 
Directors in connection with the grant.
