cutive Management (excluding severance 
pay to former management) amounted to 
DKK 32.3m (DKK 26.7m), representing an 
increase of 21%. The remuneration level is 
a result of an increase in variable incentives 
(STI and LTI), due to a solid business per -
formance. The base salary of the CEO was 
increased by 5% effecti reased by 5% effective January 1, 2024, 
corresponding to an annual base salary 
increase from DKK 7.4m to DKK 7.8m.

achieved at 94% of maximum, which corre -
sponds to 188% of target, and the long-term
