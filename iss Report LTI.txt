  
programme due to the completion of the recovery from the 
pandemic and the further progression on the OneISS strategy.
The Committee was confident that the programme continued 
to support the strategic journey, i.e. focus on profit growth 
while ensuring a strong margin, a robust free cash flow, and 
progression on the sustainability agenda.
2024 share-based incentives
The 2024 Long-Term Incentive Programme (LTIP) remained 
based on the same principles as the 2022 and 2023 
programmes. It is the Committee’s perspective that the 
programme continued to drive the right behaviour and 
outcomes for the long run, thus, there was no need to amend 
the programme.
