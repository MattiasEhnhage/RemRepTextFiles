  the successful 
delivery of our strategy, and create long-term shareholder 
value. These principles are used for structuring the reward 
approach throughout the organisation. 
The shareholders resolve annually on Board’s remuneration 
based on a proposal made by the Nomination Board. Given 
the nature of the Board duties and responsibilities, the 
remuneration is not linked to the Company performance, 
and therefore includes fixed remuneration only, which can 
be paid in cash, shares or a combination thereof. The Board 
Remuneration policy shall not restrict the shareholders’ 
ability to resolve on Board remuneration.
Remuneration of the CEO consists of a base salary, pension, 
and benefits, as well as short- and long-term incentives. The 
objective is to have a good balance of rewarding elements, 
and to offer competitive fixed remuneration that is 
supplemented with short- and long-term incentive schemes 
that drive company performance. 
The Board may deviate from the policy in extr s and evaluates 
performance of the CEO. Based on the Company’s 
Remuneration policy, the maximum STI reward is 
limited to 130% of the annual base salary. 
As the current CEO Sami Niiranen joined the company 
in 2024, there were no short-term incentives paid 
during 2024.
