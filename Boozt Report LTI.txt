"PSP"). Typically, the performance period is over three years, with 
threshold-in-service ("cliff-vesting") after 36 months, under 
condition that the performance criteria are met. The Board 
considering annually assigning LTI benefits, and all A measurement methods were applied to professional teams and warehouse and logistics teams in 2024.
