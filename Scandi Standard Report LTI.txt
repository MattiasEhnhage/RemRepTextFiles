subject to a three -year vesting period and provided that certain performance criteria 
(including the compound annual growth rate of earnings per share , “EPS CAGR ”) 
are fulfilled. 175,300 ordinary shares may be awarded under LTIP 2022, a 
maximum of 199,000 ordinary shares may be awarded under L y be awarded under LTIP 202 3 and a 
maximum of 259,200 ordinary shares may be awarded under LTIP 2024 . In order 
to further increase alignment between the long -term interests of the participants 
and the company’s shareholders, a requirement for participation is that the 
participant undertakes to retain all allotted shares (except for such shares that are 
sold to cover for tax due to the allotment of shares) for a period of two years from 
the date of the allotment of the shares. More information on the company’s share -
