• EPKINLY® % and 7.5%, respectively. The Company -wide merit 
increase budget was approximately 4%, and that the maximum awarded increase in the workforce was approximately 7.5%. See Base 
Salary section below for further details. 
2024 Annual Bonus for Executive Management : Based on the 
achievement of the 2024 strategic, financial and organizational performance goals, the 2024 annual bonuses were calculated at a 
factor of 101% of target and this bonus factor was applied as a 
Company factor with respect to our 2024 broad -based employee 
bonuses. 
However, with respect to the Executive Management members the 
Board of Directors holistically considered the strong performance 
achievement in the context of our 2024 TSR performance and 
determined to reduce the payout to 90% of target for the CEO and 95% 
of target for the CFO (compared to a payout of 122% in 2023). 
Consistent with the Remuneration Policy, any earned bonus in excess 
of the target bonus level (i.e., above 100% of base salary fo 0% of base salary for the CEO 
and 60% for the CFO) will be deferred into RSUs subject to three -year 
vesting. See Genmab’s Remuneration Policy for details on deferred 
RSUs as pertaining to Annual Bonus achievement. 
2024 Share- Based Long- Term Incentives : In accordance with our 
Remuneration Policy, our executives were awarded performance-based RSUs in 2024, with a target opportunity of 4x base salary and a maximum opportunity of 6x base salary. However, actual payout level 
in 2026 will be subject to fulfillment of performance criteria. The share-
based compensation expenses for our CEO and CFO increased from 
DKK 36.8 million in 2023 to DKK 50.9 million in 2024. The RSU awards 
granted in 2022 for our CEO and CFO are expected to be earned at 
80.325% of the maximum opportunity based on performance

14 Executive Compensation Philosophy 
The following is a description of our philosophies related to Pay for Performance, Global Compensation Perspective and Compensation Peer Group. 
Pay for Performance 
Our executive compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect Genmab’s commitment to reward short - and long- term performance that 
aligns with, and drives, shareholder value. 
• The majority of compensation for the Executive Management is performance- based and a substantial portion is delivered in the form of 
performance share- based compensatio inst the weighted financial, operational and strategic goals. 
 
The target annual bonus is 100% for the CEO and 60% for the CFO, calculated as a percentage of annual base salary. The payout range for the 
Annual Bonus Plan is determined as a percentage of the target opportunity based on performance, as shown below. 
 
Performance rating % of target 
Exceed timelines and/or targets* 101% – 150% 
Meet timelines and/or targets 100% 
Miss timelines and/or targets* 40% – 99% 
Significantly miss timelines and/or targets 0% 
 
* The Board of Directors will assess performance and the applicable payout within range. 
 
We use scorecards in our discussion of the performance of the Executive Management to illustrate how our results compare to the goals established 
by the Board of Directors early in the year, based on our business plan for the year. The Committee sets performance standards for each measure 
so that achievement below ‘target’ results in a reduction of the pay outcome. 
2024 Goal  al bonus RSUs in the table above represent RSUs granted in 2024, related to 2023 performance. 
 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Compensation Committee believes the grant of equity awards enhances our ability to retain our Executive Management by providing a portion 
of their long -term incentive in the form of equity awards that will be fully earned only if they remain with us for several years. The value of equity 
awards granted to each Executive Management member is intended to be market competitive and reflective of each executive’s skill set, experience, role and responsibilities. 
 In accordance with our Remuneration Policy, our CEO and CFO received equity award grants in 2024 with a target opportunity of 4x base salary 
and a maximum opportunity of 6x base salary. Additionally, the Compensation Committee has increased the degree of difficulty of achieving the applicable goals such that the 2024 equity grant structure and disclosures within this Compensation Report include target  ar performance goals. Accordingly, the 2024 Performance -Based RSUs will vest on March 1, 
2027, subject to the degree of fulfilment of the applicable performance categories outlined below. 
 
The goal categories and weightings for the 2024 Performance -Bases RSUs are included in the following table:
