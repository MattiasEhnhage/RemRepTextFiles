Share -based remuneration 
Share -based and share price -based incentive programmes outstanding 
The Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2022 resolved to introduce a long -term incentive programme 
(“LTIP 2022”) for senior executives and other key individuals. Assuming that the participant has invested 
in shares in the Company or used previously owned shar es for the programme (savings shares), they have 
been allocated a matching share right and two performance share rights for each savings share. The CEO 
has allocated 296,368 savings shares to the progr  shares to the programme and subsequently been allocated 296,368 
matching s hare rights and 592,736 performance share rights. 
The share rights have been allocated free of charge, and are subject to a three -year vesting period , and 
are conditional on the participant’s continued employment. The vesting of performance shares is also 
contingent on fulfilment of applicable performance conditions. These are related to EBIT margin 
(measured as an average over the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024) and net growth 
(measured as an average over the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024). The number of 
performance shares vested depend on the extent to which the performance conditions are fulfilled. As of 
31 December 2024 , a total of 2,811,555 matching share rights and performance share rights were 
outsta nding, which corresponds to 1.1 percent of the s hares in the Company after dilution.
