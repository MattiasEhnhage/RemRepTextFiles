 amount to not more than 30 percent of the 
fixed annual cash salary. The Managing Director’s variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. Any other 
executive’s variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement 
provisions. If the variable cash remuneration qualifies for pension benefits, the pension premiums for premium defined pension shall 
amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.
Other benefits
Other benefits may include, for example, life insurance, medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring) and company cars. Such benefits 
may amount to not more than ten percent of the fixed annual cash salary.
For employments governed by rules other than Swedish, pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with 
mandatory rules or established local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.
