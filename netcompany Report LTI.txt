Since 2023, earnings targets have been 
based on organic adjusted EBITDA instead of 
organic adjusted EBITA. Additionally, the LTIP 
targets have been based on annual targets in 
a three-year period rather than an average 
target for the period set at the time for grant. 
All targets are measured in constant 
currencies. 
The targets are in line with the strategic 
objectives of the Group and thereby tied to 
targets in line with the long-term strategy of 
Netcompany.
For each year, the Board of Directors grants 
RSUs to the Executive Management with a 
maximum value of 80% of the fixed base 
salary.
