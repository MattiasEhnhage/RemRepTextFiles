10) The  ITY REPORT 2024Share ­based remuneration
The aim of Electrolux Professional’s long-term incentive plans (LTI) is 
to attract and retain competent senior employees, and to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants. The plans have been designed to align management incentives with shareholder interests.
During 2024, the company had three ongoing performance 
share programs (LTI 2022, LTI 2023 and LTI 2024) for senior man-agers and key employees, including the President and CEO. All programs run over a three-year vesting period including a one-year performance period. The allocation of shares in the 2022 program is determined by the position level and the outcome of two objectives: (i) earnings per share and (ii) operating cash flow after investments.The allocation of shares in the 2023 program is determined by theposition level and the outcome of three objectives: (i) earningsper share, (ii) operating cash flow after investments and (iii) CO₂emission reduction O₂emission reduction. The allocation of shares in the 2024 program isdetermined by the participant's position level and the outcome ofthree objectives: (i) earnings per share, (ii) return on net assets and(iii) CO₂ emission reduction.
Performance outcome of the objectives in the three plans is de-
termined by the Board after the expiry of the respective one-year performance period for each program. 
Allocation of shares is based on performance, and performance 
objectives are linear from minimum to maximum. If the maximum is reached or exceeded, 100% of the maximum granted shares to each participant will be allocated. If the performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level, a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance does not reach the minimum level. The shares will be allocated after the vesting period free of charge except for tax 
liabilities. 
If a participant’s employment is terminated during the respective 
thre the respective 
three-year vesting period of each program, the participant will be excluded from the program and will not receive any shares or other benefits under the program. However, in certain instances, including a participant’s death, disability, retirement, or the divestiture of the participant’s employing company, a participant could be entitled to reduced benefits under the program.
All programs comprise Class B shares. Additional information 
about the outstanding LTI programs can be found in Note 26 in the Annual Report 2024.
