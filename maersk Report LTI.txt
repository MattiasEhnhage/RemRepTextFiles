based on a defined scorecard with relevant leading and lagging 
indicators supporting the transformation journey.

Long-term incentive plan
The purpose of long-term incentive (LTI) is to incentivise the 
achievement of sustainable company performance by linking a 
sizeable portion of the total remuneration to company results 
and the development in share price over time. The long-term 
incentive plan is furthermore in place to support the retention 
of the Executive Board members. 
 In line with our Policy, the members of the Executive Board 
received their annual grants in 2024 under the Performance 
Share Plan. This marks the second grant since transitioning to 
the Performance Share Plan in 2023. 
 For the LTI plan in 2024, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 
selected as the main metric to ensure alignment with the interests 
of shareholders. The weight of ROIC has been increased to 80%, 
compared to 60% in the 2023
