The remuneration guidelines 
A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company’s business strategy and safeguarding of the Company’s long-term inter-ests, including its sustainability, is that Indutrade is able to recruit and 
retain management with high qualifications. To this end, the Company 
must offer competitive remuneration and other terms of employment. The forms of compensation should motivate members of executive management to do their utmost in order to safeguard the interests of the shareholders. The total compensation shall be on market terms, 
straightforward, long-term and quantifiable, and may consist of the 
following components: fixed cash salary, variable cash compensation, pension benefits and other benefits. Variab mes.The plans are clearly linked to the business strategy and the Company’s long-term value creation by being linked to earnings development. 
Variable cash remuneration 
Variable cash remuneration is linked to predetermined and measur-able criteria with a clear connection to the company’s financial targets. The outcome is linked to the fulfilment of established goals concerning the Group’s profit before taxes and working capital efficiency for per-sons in Group roles. For business area managers, the outcome is linked 
to the relevant business area’s EBITA result and working capital effi-
ciency. The Board of Directors is responsible for making that assess-ment as regards the CEO. For the other members of the Group man-agement team, the CEO makes the assessment. The outcome for the 2024 financial year amounts to 28% (97) of the maximum outcome 
for the CEO and 38% (82) as an average for others in the Group 
management team. Outstanding share and share price-related 
incentive programme s respectively which, after the relevant programme period has ended, may entitle him to receive the same number of Indutrade shares. 
In connection with the launch of the performance-based share 
programmes, the Board also adopted a policy for senior executives’ 
share ownership. The recommended share ownership over time in relation to fixed annual salary is 100% for the CEO and 50% for other members of the Group management team.
