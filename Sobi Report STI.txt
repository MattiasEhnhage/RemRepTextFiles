have been designed in a way that encourages compliant 
behaviour . 
Set out below is a description of how the criteria for payment of 
variable short - and long -term compensation have been applied 
during the financial year. 
Performance of the CEO and the deputy CEO in the reported 
financial year: short term variable cash remuneration 
As to the short -term variable remuneration (“STI”), the B oard of 
Directors has made both quantitative and qualitative 
assessments. This has involved the application of judgement and discretion to ensure that the outcome will reflect broader 
considerations and remain appropriate and proportionate, in addition to the formulaic outcome on the basis of scorecards. Accordingly, the short -term variable cash remuneration for the 
financial year 202 4 was determined by both financial and non-
financial performance criteria. The financial performance criteria 
consisted of annual reve nue (relative l reve nue (relative weighting 52 .5%) and EBITA 
(relative weighting 22 .5%). The non -financial performance criteria 
were selected based on strategic objectives as well as short -term 
and long -term business development goals for 202 4 (relative 
weighting 25 %). 
The evaluation of the performance criteria resulted in a remuneration outcome for the CEO Guido Oelkers amounting to 
kSEK 11,382, whereof kSEK 5,593 is related to annual revenue, 
kSEK 2,745 to EBITA and k SEK 3,043 to the non -financial 
objectives. For the deputy CEO Henrik Stenqvist, the evaluation of 
the performance criteria resulted in a remuneration outcome 
amounting to k SEK 2,707, whereof k SEK 1,330 is related to annual 
revenue, kSEK 653 to EBITA and k SEK 724 to the non -financial 
objectives.
