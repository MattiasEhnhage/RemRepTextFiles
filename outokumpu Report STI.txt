 r 2024 because of weak financial results.
Sustainability in all its aspects continues to be at the core of our operations. Safety has 
been a target in all short-term incentive plans, including for the CEO, for many years. Since 
2023, diversity has also been included as a target in the short-term incentive plan for top 
leaders, though it does not apply to the CEO. CO 2 emission reduction also remained a key 
target in our long-term incentive program, the Performance Share Plan, in which the CEO 
and close to 200 leaders participate.
Going forward, we will continue to review our remuneration framework to ensure it supports 
value delivery for all our stakeholders.Performance and remuneration trends 2020–2024 from 2019 baseline
