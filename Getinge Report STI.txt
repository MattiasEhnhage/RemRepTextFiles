Principles for the application of performance 
targets for variable remuneration
Selection of performance targets and resolution to determine the 
variable remuneration has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee and resolved by the Board of Directors. The variable 
remuneration is pre-limited to a maximum amount and related to 
predetermined and measurable criteria, designed to contribute 
to the interests of shareholders and the company’s core values 
and creates an incentive for joint efforts to achieve the company’s Percentage of fixed and variable remuneration in 2024

business strategy, long-term added value and the sustainable 
development of the company. The sustainability work is integrated 
in the company’s day-to-day operations. If the company’s principles 
for sustainability or ethical inability or ethical guidelines are not complied with, the 
company has the possibility to withhold any variable remuneration 
or reclaim already awarded remuneration.
After the end of the fiscal year and based on a proposal by the 
Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors has resolved 
to which extent the criteria for payment of the short- and long-term variable remuneration have been fulfilled. The assessment 
if the financial targets have been reached has been based on the 
company’s most recent published financial information, with any 
adjustments approved by the Board of Directors at the proposal of 
the Remuneration Committee.
