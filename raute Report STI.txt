Remuneration is tied to business objectives, financial per -
formance, and the implementation of our strategy, which is 
strongly centered on sustainable development.
Improving profitability and growth are key strategic objectives 
at Raute. These objectives are emphasized in both short-term 
and long-term incentive metrics. Raute’s revenue and profita -
bility improved in 2023 compared to the previous loss-making 
year. Based on this, the CEO’s remuneration in 2024 included 
paid incentives from short-term and long-term incentive 
programs based on previous years’ performance. Additionally, as part of the total remuneration, a retention bonus was paid 
from the conditional share reward system, which was granted 
to the CEO upon starting in his position. The company’s positi -
ve development in terms of growth and profitability improve -
ment continued in 2024.
Remuneration policy
In 2024, Raute’s Board of Directors updated the company’s 
remuneration policy for governing bodies. Th n of the CEO is in line with our culture of encouraging strong performance. A 
significant part of the CEO’s remuneration is based on a variable share. In order to maintain a 
strong connection between the company’s result and the CEO’s remuneration, the performance 
targets of both the short-term and long-term incentive plans are directly linked to Raute’s busi -
ness result. In addition, the CEO is expected to use a share, as specified by the Board, of the net 
remuneration of the long-term incentive plan to accrue his shareholding until the shareholding 
reaches the level specified by the Board. This is to ensure that the interests of the CEO and the 
shareholders are aligned.
