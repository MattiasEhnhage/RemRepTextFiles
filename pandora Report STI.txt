2023EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION BENCHMARKING
Executive remuneration is reviewed annually 
against benchmarks from C25 and European 
companies comparable to Pandora in size, 
complexity and market capitalisation. In 2024, the 
peer groups used for assessment were established 
at the start of the year and remained consistent 
with those applied in 2023. To further enhance 
Pandora’s ability to attract and retain global talent, 
a US peer benchmark group was introduced in 
2024. This group, developed with guidance from 
our independent advisor, Willis Towers Watson 
(WTW), was added to complement the primary 
and secondary peer groups. Additionally, Pandora received advice from WTW on market data and 
remuneration trends.

CORPORATE PERFORMANCE
The chart below shows Pandora’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) over the 
past five years, and overlays this against CEO total 
remuneration over the period. Our strategy has delivered 
significant shareholder returns, with a 351% increase in 
value (based on a hypothetical investment in Pandora 
shares made at the start of 2020). CEO remuneration, 
based on salary, bonus earned and LTIP grants, has 
remained broadly consistent over the period, except for 
the additionally awarded CEO Special Award in 2024.EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION

EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT
REMUNERATION
COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE 
MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION
Members of Executive Management receive the 
following remuneration:
• Fixed annual base salary (members of Executive 
Management do not receive any company-paid 
pension contributions). 
• STIP, based on Pandora’s performance during 
the current performance year.
• LTIP, based on Pandora’s performance during 
a three-year performance period, and with a 
further two-year holding period before shares 
awarded can be sold (five-year vesting and 
holding period in total).
• Other customary benefits on terms generally 
aligned with the wider work force.
The combination of fixed and incentive-based 
remuneration has been chosen to ensure that 
Pandora has the flexibility to recruit and retain 
key talent in a highly competitive, international 
talent market. The Board of Directors (“the Board”) 
believes that incentive plans can be key drivers 
behind exceptional Pandora performance  s, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, 
G-III Apparel, Guess?, Movado Group.to DKK 6.7 million (2024). These increases are 
consistent with the range of increases awarded to 
the wider work force of Pandora A/S. The Board 
approved the recommendation effective from 1 
March 2024. The fixed annual base salary (annual 
salary including any pension contributions) and 
overall reward opportunity provided to the CEO 
and CFO are considered to be broadly competitive 
with the appropriate peer groups. Salary increases 
in future years are expected to evolve in line with 
the pay-for-performance principles set out in the 
Remuneration Policy.10

SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP)
The STIP is cash-based and designed to incentivise 
and encourage Executive Management to achieve 
high performance and promote achievement of 
Pandora’s short-term objectives on a basis that is 
consistent, overall, with the sustainable delivery of 
long-term objectives. Our guiding philosophy is to 
reward employees based on the tangible impact 
they have on Pandora’s performance. For instance, 
leaders within specific geographical clusters would 
receive compensation mainly in accordance with 
the performance of their respective region. The 
performance targets for Executive Management 
are therefore aligned with the global short-term 
performance of Pandora. It is Pandora’s practice 
to communicate KPIs after the end of Executive 
Managements' perf e 
Managements' performance period due to the 
commercial sensitivity of the financial KPIs.EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION
