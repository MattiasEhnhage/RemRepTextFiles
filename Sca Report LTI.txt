 ainability Condition was that the average annual 
climate benefit increased during the performance period compared to the average annual climate 
benefit during the financial years 2019‒2021. For maximum payment under the Sustainability 
Condition, it was required that the average annual climate benefit increased by 1.5 million tonnes 
of CO 2 equivalents during the performance period compared to the average annual climate 
benefit during the financial years 2019‒2021. If the TSR for the company’ s class B share and the 
climate benefit amounted to a level between the minimum level and the maximum level during 
the performance period, a linear payment would be made. 
The performance criteria for LTI 2023‒2025 are based on a financial target consisting of the total 
return (“TSR”) on the company’s c lass B share during a performance period consisting of the 
financial years 202 3‒202511, which shall be measured to 60 percent in relation to a benchmark 
group of other companies12 and to  n be found in Note C3 on pages 103–105 
of the Annual Report 2024.

performance period, decresed by 1 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalents compared to the average 
annual climate benefit over the financial years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The performance outcome 
for LTI 2022‒2024 has resulted in the CEO receiving a total of KSEK 1,853, of which KSEK 
1,853 for the fulfilment of the TSR condition and KSEK 0 for the fulfilment of the sustainability
