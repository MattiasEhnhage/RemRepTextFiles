cluding strategy and sustainability progress. 
The long-term incentive consists of two com -
ponents, Restricted Share Units (“RSU’s”) and 
Share Options. The long-term incentive com -
ponents are in place to link the remuneration of 
the Executive Board member to the sustained 
performance of DFDS (as reflected in the share 
price) whilst at the same time supporting the 
retention of Executive Board members. Vesting 
is conditioned on leaver provisions only.For short-term and long-term incentive 
awards provided as of 1 January 2021 or 
later, the Board can reduce the size of the 
awards before (Malus) and after (Claw-
back) payment/vesting/exercise, e.g. to be 
applied in the case of awards being granted 
based on misstated information or breach 
of obligations. In 2024, the option to re -
claim remuneration was not used.
