Subject to the employee having made an own investment in shares in NCAB (investment-
shares), the employee has been awarded four performance-shares. In this plan, the CEO has 
invested in 40 000 investment shares and thus been awarded 160 000 performance-shares 
for 2024. The performance-shares have been awarded free of charge and are subject to a 
three-year vesting period and continued employment. Vesting of performance-shares is also 
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. The performance condition is 
measured as EBITA deducted by 12% interest on total capital employed year three compared 
to plan which is aligned with the company’s financial targets. For information on the number 
of performance shares encompassed by the three ongoing programs in 2024, see note 26 on 
pages 60-61 of the Annual Report 2024.
