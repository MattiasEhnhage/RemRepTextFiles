Application of the performance conditions 
A prerequisite fo s 
A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long -
term interests, including its sustainability goals, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. 
To this end, it is n ecessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. Billerud's remuneration guidelines 
enable the company to offer the CEO a competitive total remuneration. By establishing that variable compensation 
shall be linked to predetermined and measurable f inancial and non -financial criteria, the variable cash remuneration, 
together with Billerud's share- based incentive programs, promote Billerud's business strategy, long -term interests 
and sustainability performance. 
The performance conditions and targets for variable cash compensation to the CEO for 2024 included a set of pre-
determined and measurable corporate performance measures linked to Billerud's strategy (Group EBIT, Operating 
Cash Flow and Group Lost Time In ese programs are intended to attract, motivate, and retain the 
participating employees by providing long -term incentives through awards li nked to the company's share price. 
They have been designed to align the participants incentives with shareholder interests. 
As per 31 December 2024, the company had three ongoing share- based incentive programs (2022, 2023 and 2024) 
resolved by the annual general meeting (the " programs "). 
The 2022 program targeted a maximum of 60 employees including the CEO and the other Group Management 
Team members as well as other key personnel and talents. The 2023 and 2024 programs follow the same overall 
structure as the 2022 program but targeted a maximum of 80 employees and also includes employees within the North American operations, which was acquired in 2022. 
The 2022- 2024 programs measure one financial performance condition; earnings per share (EPS). The performance 
condition is measured during each program's duration period. In addition, th iod. In addition, the 2024 program includes a 
sustainability -related performance condition (reduction of CO2 emissions) measured based on Billerud's reduction 
of the Billerud group's CO2 emissions over the financial years 2024- 2026. In order to participate in the programs, 
the participants must own shares corresponding to an amount decided by t he annual general meeting. The 
participants are offered an opportunity to receive shares in Billerud subject to that the participant, with a few 
exceptions, is employed in Billerud and fulfils the shareholding requirement during the program 's three -year vesting 
period. The award that can be received at vesting of the programs is dependent on the level of fulfilment of the 
performance conditions.

structure, in terms of, inter alia , performance conditions and investment in savings shares as well as allotment of 
share rights, compared to the 2022, 2023 and 2024 programs.

THE BOARD' S PROPOSAL FOR A PERFORMANCE BASED LONG -TERM SHARE PROGRAM 
(ITEM 16 ON THE AGENDA) 
IMPLEMENT ATION OF A PERFORMANCE BASED LONG -TERM SHARE PROGRAM FOR 202 5 
(ITEM 16(A) ON THE AGENDA) 
The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a performance based long -term share 
program for G MT members and other key employees in Billerud (" Share Program 2025 "). The Share Program 
2025 is different than the share program s for 2021- 2024 in terms of, inter alia , performance conditions and 
investment in Saving S hares (defined below) as well as allocation of s l as allocation of share rights, where Share Program 2025 has a 
similar structure as Billerud's previous share programs . The financial performance condition (earnings per share) 
remains and is measured , as in the 2023 and 2024 programs, as accumulated earnings per share. In addition, an 
additional financial performance condition has been added for Share Program 2025 related to the average 
percentage return on capital employed (ROCE). Further, Share Program 2025, like the 2024 program, contains a 
sustainability -related performance condition (reduction of CO 2 emissions), measured based on Billerud 's reduction 
of the Billerud g roup's CO 2 emissions. The outcome of all three performance conditions in Share Program 2025 is 
measured during the financial years 2025 -2027 (the " Measurement Period "). The performance conditions are 
described in detail below. 
As has been the case in previous long -term share -based incentive programs , having an own holding of Billerud 
shares al  Billerud 
shares allocated to Share program 2025 (" Saving Shares ") is a condition to participate in Share Program 202 5. The 
investment in Saving Shares is a prerequisite for being allotted Billerud shares free of charge following the vesting 
period, which ends in connection with the publication of Billerud's interim report for the fourth quarter of 2027 
(the " Vesting Period "). 
The structure of Share Program 2025 aims t o create clarity and predictability for the participants and to further 
align the interests of the participants with the interests of the shareholders. The board is convinced that the 
proposed share program will benefit the company' s shareholders as it will contribute to the opportunity to recruit 
and retain strategically important employees, is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation for the 
participants in the program and will strengthen the partici pants ' ties to the Billerud group and its shareholders. 
Participants in Share Program 202 in Share Program 2025 
Share Program 2025 comprises a maximum of 80 participants in the G roup Management Team (GMT) and key 
employees within the Billerud Group, divided into three categories: the CEO (" Category 1 "), other members of

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 202 5 BILLERUD AKTIEBOLAG (PUBL) 
16 
 
the GMT , approximately 8 participants (" Category 2") and other key employees, approximately 71 participants 
("Category 3"). 
The personal investment 
To be entitled to participate in Share Program 2025 , the employees must allocate Saving Shares to the program. 
Billerud shares already held , but not already allocated to another outstanding incentive program, may be used as 
Saving Shares. Saving Shares shall be allocated to Share Program 2025 in connection with the notification to 
participate in the program. If the participant has inside information and is therefore prevented from acquiring 
shares in Billerud in connection with the notification to participate in the program, the acqui e program, the acquisition of shares shall 
take place as soon a s possible when the participant is no longer prevented from trading. 
The p articipant in Category 1 is offered to allocate Saving Shares to Share Program 2025 up to a number 
corresponding to 15 percent of the participant's annual gross base salary at year -end 2024 divided by the closing 
price of the Billerud share on the last trading day of 2024 ( SEK 101.40). Participants in Categories 2 and 3 are 
offered to allocate Saving Shares to Share Program 2025 up to a number corresponding to 10 percent of the 
participant's annual gross base salary at year -end 2024 divided by the closing price of the Billerud share o n the last 
trading day of 2024. New employees who have not yet started their employment when application for participation 
in Share Program 2025 is to be made at the latest may, subject to the employment starting during 20 25, be offered 
participation in Share Program 202 5 if the remuneration committee dee lated on the 
basis of the financial information presented in Billerud's interim reports for the Measurement Period (adjusted for 
items affecting comparability). 
Series C - Reduction of CO 2 emissions 
The sustainability -related performance condition CO 2 emission reduction is calculated on the basis of the CO 2 
emission reduction information presented in Billerud's external reporting for the Measurement Period, and reflects 
Billerud's high aspirations throughout its sustainability work. 
Fulfilment of performance conditions 
The levels of each performance condition (threshold and maximum level , respectively ) have been resolved by the 
board. If the maximum level is reached, the allotment will amount to one (1) Billerud share per share right related 
to the relevant performance condition. If the threshold level is not reached, no allotment of shares will occur . If 
fulfilment of the relevant performance condition is between the threshold level and maximum level, the allotment 
 sts and with reasonable administrative efforts, the remuneration 
committee shall be entitled to decide that the participant may instead be offered a cash settlement of the entire 
allotment under the Share Program 202 5. The remuneration committee shall also be entitle d to make other 
adjustments, including e.g. the right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Billerud shares, if material changes would 
occur within the Billerud group or on the market that, according to the board 's assessment, would mean that the 
resolved terms and conditions for allotment of shares in accordance with the Share Program 202 5 no longer fulfil 
its main objectives. 
Scope 
Share Program 2025 comprises a maximum of 1 70,000 Saving Shares, which may result in allotment of a maximum 
of 598,000 Billerud shares, corresponding to approximately 0.24 percent of the total number of outstanding shares 
and votes in Billerud. 
The number of shares included in Share Program 2025 which may be transferred to the pa
