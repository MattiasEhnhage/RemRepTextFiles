SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES
The CEO’s short-term incentive at the target level is 55% 
and at the maximum 100% of the fixed annual salary. The 
short-term incentive is linked to the achievement of the 
Siili Group’s financial targets in terms of revenue (weight 
30%), EBITA (weight 50%), personnel satisfaction 
(weight 10%) and utilization in Siili Finland (weight 10%).
None of the minimum targets of the CEO’s short-
term incentive scheme were achieved in the financial 
year 2024, and therefore no rewards under the 
short-term incentive scheme were accrued for 2024. With respect to Group revenue, the realization was 
85% of the target level, 59% of the EBITA target 
level, 50% of the employee satisfaction target 
level and 97% of the utilization target level.
