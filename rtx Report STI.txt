nents: 
 a) Fixed base salary.

The composition of the remuneration of each individual member of 
the Executive Board is determined so as to facilitate the Company’s 
ability to attract and retain qualified management while at the same 
time ensuring the Executive Board has incentives to create added

tion. The terms of employment and remuneration of the members of the
