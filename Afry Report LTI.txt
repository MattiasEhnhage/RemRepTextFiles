The President and CEO ’s long -term share -price -related cash incentive programme (“CEO LTI 2021 -
2024”) 
According to the terms and conditions specified in the remuneration guidelines resolved on the Annual 
General Meeting 2022, the President and CE O participated in a long- term share -price -related cash 
programme based on the share price development during the period April 2021 – March 2024 
(inclusive). For t he threshold value for allotment , the share price development had to exceed 0 
percent as a minimum level , and reach 30 percent as a maximum level. Payment was to be made on 
a linear basis between the minimum level and the maximum level. If the maximum level was reached, 
and the President and CEO was still employed by AFRY, he would have been entitled to a payment of 
7.5 MSEK (gross, before tax). The CEO LTI 2021 -2024 was subject to so -called vesting during 2024 but 
did  uring 2024 but 
did not result in any payout as the threshold value was not reached. The program me was not renewed . 
Long-term cash programme s 
The A nnual General Meeting 2022 adopted a cash -based long- term incentive programme , the format 
of which has continued to be proposed and adopted at the Annual General Meetings in 2023 and 
2024. The programme s are the result of a review conducted by the R emuneration Committee in 2021 
with the conclusion that the Company should offer a long- term performance -based incentive 
programme as part of the employees ’ total remuneration. The programmes aim to align participants ’ 
incentives and shareholders ’ interests through two strategically important financial performance 
conditions for AFRY, growth and EBITA margin. After a predetermined measurement period, the 
participant is entitled to a cash payment, depending on the degree of fulfilment of the perform ance 
conditions. For half of the amount paid to the participant, net after ta tegories: the President and CEO , the Group 
Executive Management and other key employees. Performance wa s measured based on average 
growth and EBITA margin over three years (weighted 50/50) and payment s to participants in the 
program me occurred after the third year (conditional upon the participants still being employe d by 
the Company ). The v ested amount was calculated on the average annual salary during the 
measurement period. 
During 2024, t he President and CEO participate d in all outstanding long-term cash program mes.
