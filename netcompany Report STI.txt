Since 2023, earnings targets have been 
based on organic adjusted EBITDA instead of 
organic adjusted EBITA. Additionally, the LTIP 
targets have been based on annual targets in 
a three-year period rather than an average 
target for the period set at the time for grant. 
All targets are measured in constant 
currencies. 
The targets are in line with the strategic 
objectives of the Group and thereby tied to 
targets in line with the long-term strategy of 
Netcompany.
For each year, the Board of Directors grants 
RSUs to the Executive Management with a 
maximum value of 80% of the fixed base 
salary.
Extraordinary remuneration
As an extraordinary incentive element, the 
Board of Directors may grant matching shares 
to the Executive Management under a match-
i ent in the payout ratios. 
In 2024, the Executive Management was 
granted DKK 11.6m in LTIP , compared to DKK 
10.4m in 2023. Compared to 2023, the 
granted LTIP for the Executive Management 
increased by 11.5% in nominal amount as a 
direct consequence of the increase in the 
base salary. 
During 2024, part of the LTIP granted was 
cancelled as targets were partly met for out -
standing programmes. The cancellation 
amounted DKK 10.2m, which was a decrease 
compared to 2023, where DKK 7.1m of the 
LTIP lapsed. The development was caused by 
three programmes having targets for 2024 
compared to two programmes last year. 
Benefits paid during 2024 was on level with 
the benefits paid in 2023.
