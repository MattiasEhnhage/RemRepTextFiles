Outstanding share-based and share-price-related incentive plans
During the year, NCC had three ongoing long-term performance-based incentive programs for senior
executives and key personnel: 2021–2023, 2023–2025 and 2024–2026. The programs run over
three years.
LTI 2021 was concluded and settled in 2024.
No long-term performance-based incentive program LTI 2022 was launched (for the 2022–2024
period).
For participation in the LTI programs, participants must have personally invested in shares, savings
shares. For LTI 2024, the participants were divided into four categories, including:
 The CEO (one person) who may acquire savings shares for an amount capped at 8 percent of his basic salary
and is entitled to receive a maximum of five performance shares for each savings share held.
 Members of the SMT (11 people) who may acquire savings shares for an amount capped at 6 percent of their
basic salary and are entitled to receive a maximum of four performance shares for each savi shares for each savings share held.
For LTI 2024, the targets consist of EPS for each year of the period separately, as well as a smaller
component relating to a reduction in the Group’s carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2, as well as a
reduction in the number of work-related accidents.

employee of the NCC Group at the end of the vesting period, three years after the starting date. A
maximum of 240 employees have been invited to participate in the respective programs.
