This Remuneration Report describes the remuneration received by each member of the Board of Directors and Executive Management of 
Novo Nordisk A/S as registered with the Danish Business Authority in 2024. The non-registered executives are not covered by this remuneration report unless explicitly 
mentioned. Th oard of Directors discretionarily adjusted the STIP 2024 group 
performance down by 16%.
As a result of the overall strategic progress and business performance in 2024 as well as his individual 
performance, the Board determined that the short-term incentive programme for the CEO for 2024 is 69% 
of the maximum incentive equalling 8.25 months’ base salary. The performance of the long-term incentive 
programme (LTIP) for 2024 is tracking above or around targets. In 2024, the total remuneration of the CEO 
amounted to DKK 57.1 million, of which 42% is not yet finally determined and 45% is deferred. Moreover, the 
final performance of the LTIP 2022 is 89% of the maximum allocation, while the LTIP 2023 performance is 
tracking above targets.
In our Remuneration Report 2023, we outlined a series of proposed adjustments to our Remuneration Policy, 
which were subsequently presented for approval as part of the full Remuneration Policy at the Annual General 
Meeting in March 2024. I refer to s ompared to a global sales and operating profit 
growth in 2023 of 36% and 44% at CER, respectively). In 2024, the total remuneration for the CEO amounted to DKK 57.1 million (DKK 68.2 million in 2023) of which 
42% is not yet finally determined and 45% is deferred. Of the total remuneration, 36% is fixed, and 64% is 
variable. The decrease in the CEOs total remuneration from 2023 to 2024 was -16%, and is a result of lower 
performance across both STIP 2024 and LTIP 2024. 
The base salary of the CEO was increased by 3.5% in line with other employees in Novo Nordisk A/S due to 
general salary inflation. 
The STIP 2024 is based on targets aligned with Novo Nordisk’s Strategic Aspirations 2025 and on an 
assessment of individual contributions. As a result of the solid performance in 2024 and the discretionary 
downward adjustment, the Board determined that the short-term incentive for the CEO for 2024 was 69% 
of the maximum short-term incentive (96% in 2023) equalling 8.25 months’ base sa  variable remuneration is designed to promote 
performance in line with Novo Nordisk’s strategy. The variable remuneration is based on a number of targets 
that must be achieved before the incentive is released to the executive. Targets are aligned with short- and 
long-term strategic priorities in the corporate strategy and thereby ensure that the long-term interests and the 
sustainability of Novo Nordisk are considered.
When determining the remuneration paid to Executive Management, the Board refers to market benchmarks and 
considers the balance between fixed and variable pay, as well as the threshold, target and maximum achievement 
levels determined for variable pay. Also, the Board considers the individual executives and their roles. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s and the Board’s assessment that this approach is functioning properly and ensures 
remuneration that is fair, not excessive and which supports the recruitment of qualified candidates for executive roles.Remunerati ed benefits in line with the Remuneration Policy.VariableShort-term incentive 
programme (STIP)The STIP is a one-year short-term cash-based incentive programme linked to the 
degree of achievement of a number of predefined targets for each executive. The 
STIP is comprised of individual targets and corporate targets that typically reflect 
areas such as commercial execution, financials, purpose & sustainability, and 
innovation & therapeutic focus. 
The STIP cannot exceed an amount equal to 12 months' base salary per year for 
the CEO and the executive vice presidents.The Board assessed that the outcome of the group performance in 2024 is 75% of maximum pay-out, 
including the discretionary downward adjustment of 16%. Moreover, the Board assessed the individual 
performance of the CEO to 50% of maximum, cf. table 13 below, resulting in a pay-out of 69% of the 
maximum pay-out equalling 8.25 months’ base salary, and the individual performance of the CFO to 67% 
of maximum, cf. table 14   of the CEO and CFO remuneration at ‘on-target performance’ for 2024 revealed the
