Application of performance criteria 
The performance criteria for the CEO's variable remuneration have been chosen to realize the company's strategy and to encourage 
Actions that are in the company's long -term interest. When choosing performance criteria, the strategic goals as well as short - and long -term 
Business priorities for 202 4 were taken into account. The non -financial performance criteria further contribute to adaptation to sustainability and the company's 
values.
