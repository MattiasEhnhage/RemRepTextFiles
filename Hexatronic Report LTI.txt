performance share rights can be obtained. The performance share rights have been granted free of 
charge and are subject to a three- year vesting period and require continued employment. Vesting of 
performance shares also requires fulfilment of performance conditions - earnings per share after 
dilution per financial year 2022- 2026 for the group ( the “Share Target”), net sales growth per financial 
year 2022- 2026 for the group (the “Growth Target”) and EBITA margin per financial year 2022- 2026 
for the group ( the “EBITA target”) . For the LTIP programs that started in 2022 and 2023, the relative 
weighting is 1/3 between the performance conditions. For the LTIP program that started in 2024, the 
share target is weighted at forty (40) percent, and the growth target and EBITA target are weighted at 
twenty -five (25) percent each. In addition to these, certain sustainability targets (the 'Sustainability 
Target') are weighted at ten (10) percent.
