 evelopment of 
remuneration and fees
On the next page is a comparative description that pres-
ents the remuneration of the Board of Directors, CEO, and 
employees, as well as the development of the Company’s 
financial performance.
The decrease in the total fees paid to the Board of 
Directors in 2024 is explained by the decrease in the 
number of Board and Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee meetings. Fees paid to the CEO include 
all payments made to the CEO during this period. Any 
non-recurring fees and double fees of the CEO are ex -
cluded from the review in order to keep the development 
of fees comparable.
The total pay costs for employees increased compared 
to the previous year. The increase was mainly due to 
the increase in the amount of short-term performance 
bonuses. Pay data for employees is presented as average 
pay costs per employee.

REVENIO | REMUNERATION REPORTShort-term incentive scheme (STI)
The purpose of the short-term incentive scheme is to support the achievement of Revenio’s annual financial and 
strategic objectives. The payment of the short-term incentive is based on the meeting of performance criteria 
during the performance period. The performance criteria are decided by the Board of Directors. Revenio CEO’s an-
nual short-term incentive target level of the performance incentive per year corresponds to six months’ fixed salary 
and a maximum of twelve months’ fixed salary.
The criteria in the short-term incentive scheme are EBITDA (30% weighting), net sales growth (50% weighting) and cash 
flow (20% weighting) at the Group level and individual targets. The achievement of these criteria is described below.
It is possible for the CEO to invest an amount e e paid are the absolute total shareholder return of the company’s share (abso-
lute TSR) and Earnings per Share (EPS).
If all the performance targets set for PSP 2024-2026 are fully achieved, the aggregate 
maximum number of shares to be paid based on this plan is approximately 58,500 shares. 
This number of shares represents gross earnings, from which the portion required to cover 
the taxes arising from the share plan and other possible applicable tax-related payments 
is deducted, which is paid in cash. In practice, about 40% of the total number of shares is 
paid in shares and about 60% in cash to cover taxes and other possible tax-related pay -
ments. However, the company has the right to pay the reward fully in cash under certain 
circumstances.
The current CEO is eligible to participate in the performance plans 2021-2023, 2022-2024, 
2023-2025 and 2024-2026. In 2024 the current CEO was not given shares based on the 
2021-2023 earning period of the performance-based share bonus s
