 The remuneration of Pasi Flinkman in 2024 and a comparison to the total remunera-
tion, in case 50 percent or 100 percent of the maximum levels of incentive schemes 
would have been achieved during a similar period of employment , is illustrated below: 
Short -term incentive scheme’s (STI) purpose is to encourage and reward the CEO for 
his real isation of the business strategy and achievement of set targets for each calen-
dar year . The Board of Directors sets targets for each calendar year and assesses their 
reali sation in connection with the completion of the Financial Statements. For the CEO 
the STI scheme for the year 2024 was based on the achievement of the earnings be-
fore inte rnings be-
fore interest and taxes ( EBIT ), gross margin ( GM) and net sales (NS) targets, in accord-
ance with the Remuneration Policy. According to the STI incentive scheme, the maxi-
mum bonus is 80 percent of the CEO’ s basic annual salary . 
For the CEO, there were no significant changes to the STI scheme levels compared to 
2023. The reali sation of the STI targets for 2023 in terms of earnings was slightly above 
the minimum target level, and therefore the reali sation for the CEO was 35.07 per-
cent . De
scription of the fulfillment of the performance criteria for the CEO on the basis of 
the short -term incentive scheme (STI) (during 2022-2023 for Pekka Kuusniemi and 
during 2024 for Pasi Flinkman) :

 Breakdown of the responsibility criteria for the CEO : 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of the long -term incentive scheme (LTI) the Board assesses at the end of each 
earning period how the performance criteria has been met and the remuneration de-
pends on the CEO’s success in meeting these set targets. The remuneration paid to the 
CEO is based on the company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and is subject to the achievement of the Group’s cumulative profit target (EBIT, earnings before taxes and excluding non- recurring income and expenses). 
 With regard to the CEO, there have not been any changes in the level and structure of the 
incentive scheme in 2024. For the LTI 2021- 2023 earnings period, which ended in 2023, 
the reali sation was 0 percent. The targets for the LTI  targets for the LTI 2022- 2024 earnings period were not 
achieved for the CEO, and therefore no reward will be paid to the CEO in 2025. Pekka 
Kuusniem i’s right to take part in the LTI schemes ended at the end of the employment 
relationship . Pasi Flinkman joined the LTI scheme 2024- 2026, but he is not retroactively 
in the previous years’ schemes . Remuneration for each earning period is paid partly in the 
form of the company’s free shares and partly in cash. Purpose of the cash contribution is 
to cover taxes and tax -like payments arising from the fee to the recipient. 
 The table below shows the fulfilment of the performance criteria for Pekka Kuusniemi on the basis of the long -term (LTI) incentive scheme:
