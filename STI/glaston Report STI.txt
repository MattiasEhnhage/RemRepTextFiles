Development of remuneration in 
relation to the financial development 
of the Company
This section presents the trend of 
remuneration of the President and CEO, the Deputy CEO and the Board, 
the average employee remuneration 
and company performance for the 
financial years 2020−2024. 
In accordance with the Remuner -
ation Policy, part of the remuneration 
payable to the President and CEO 
and the Deputy CEO may consist 
of short-term and long-term incen-
tives. Criteria of such incentive plans 
are linked to the Company’s perfor -
mance (pay-for-performance) and 
thus incentive plans of Glaston ensure 
that the remuneration drives the best 
interest of the Company. 
With respect to the remuneration 
development for the financial years 
2020-2024, the following shall be noted: 
Glaston is a global company and 
the remuneration levels vary signifi-
ca nd 
2024. In 2022 strong development 
was noted, which was reflected in the 
CEO remuneration. In addition, as the 
company’s CEO has changed twice 
in the 2020−2024 period, 2022 was the 
only year with full-year remuneration 
for only one person. Due to the nature 
of the Board's duties and responsibil-
ities, the remuneration of the Board 
includes fixed remuneration only.
