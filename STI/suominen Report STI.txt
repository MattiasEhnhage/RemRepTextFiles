Jun Remuneration at Suominen
The aim of Suominen’s Remuneration Policy is to offer a 
framework for remuneration that incentivizes to pursue 
towards the Company’s long-term financial performance 
and shareholder value creation. The Policy provides the 
Company with the principles for offering remuneration 
that attracts, motivates, and retains the best possible 
management and Board members who drive Suominen’s 
performance and strategy in alignment with essential 
stakeholder interests. The Policy’s goal is to ensure that 
the philosophy of paying for performance is applied to 
Suominen’s remuneration.The Policy has the following guiding principles:
 -Total remuneration opportunity shall be competitive 
enough in relation to the market.
 -Performance-based incentives form a significant part 
of the CEO’s total target remuneration in order to 
emphasize a strong pay-for-performance alignment.
 -Majority of the performance-based incentives emphasize 
long-term, rather than short-term perfo han short-term performance and 
have a straight link to shareholder value.
 -Share ownership requirement is set for the CEO in order 
to ensure balanced risk taking.
According to the Policy, Suominen aims to offer the 
CEO a remuneration structure that incentivizes towards 
the achievement of Suominen’s strategic targets and 
long-term shareholder value creation. Suominen 
utilizes both short-term and long-term performance-
based incentives for which the Board annually selects 
appropriate performance metrics that steer towards the 
implementation of Suominen’s strategy and achievement 
of sustainable financial results in a competitive market. 
The Policy is aligned with the remuneration principles 
applied to all Suominen employees. The remuneration 
shall be fair and reflect the competencies required to fulfill 
the requirements of each position. Pay-for-performance 
philosophy is widely followed in Suominen, and many 
of the performance metrics in the CEO’s incentive plans 
are conc tive plans 
are concurrently used in employees’ incentive plans. 
However, a more significant portion of the CEO’s total 
compensation is tied to performance-based incentives, 
as the Company aims to ensure a strong link between 
executive remuneration and the Company performance.

Remuneration Report 2024

This section presents a comparison between the 
remuneration of the CEO and the Board, the average 
employee remuneration and the Company performance 
for the financial years 2020 to 2024. 
During the last five years, remuneration for the CEO 
and our employees (on average) has been quite well 
in alignment with the Company’s performance. When 
interpreting the figures in the table below, it is good  e below, it is good to 
note the following: 1. For the CEO, the figures represent remuneration 
paid during that financial year, and a portion of such 
remuneration may have been earned during the 
previous year or years. 
2. Employee pay figures, however, are accrual-based 
figures from financial statements meaning that some of 
the wages and salaries (for example bonuses) have been 
earned, but not paid during that year.
3. The average employee pay fluctuates in accordance 
with the Company’s performance, but to a lesser 
degree than executive pay, as a smaller portion of total 
remuneration consists of variable remuneration.
4. The Board members do not participate in any incentive 
schemes, and correspondingly the Board remuneration 
has remained rather stable with occasional increases to 
annual and meeting fees. Variation mainly occurs due 
to different number of Board and Committee meetings 
during the year.1.2 Pay-for-performance during the preceding five years

increase the value of the Company by offering 
a share ownership-based reward structure. The 
CEO may have share-based incentive plans, which 
reward for the Company’s performance, or which 
are used for retention purposes.
Currently Suominen’s performance-based long-
term incentive mechanism is a share-based plan, 
which offers the CEO the opportunity of earning 
a predetermined number of Suominen shares as 
a reward. Payment of the reward is dependent on 
the achievement of performance targets set by 
the Board and continued employment.
The Board resolves the maximum number of 
shares that can be earned from the plan. Long-
term incentive awards are denominated in number 
of Suominen shares but paid in shares and cash 
intending to cover the taxes that incur from the 
receipt of shares.Complies with the Policy: The CEO is eligible in 
an MRSP plan, the aim of which is to align the 
objectives of the shareholders and the CEO in 
order to increase the value of Suominen in the 
long-
