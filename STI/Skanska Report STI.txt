Application of performance criteria
The performance criteria for the President and CEO’s variable 
remuneration have been selected to deliver S elected to deliver Skanska’s strategy 
and to encourage behavior which is in the long-term interest of 
the Company and the Group. In the selection of performance 
criteria, the strategic objectives and short- and long-term 
business priorities for 2024 have been taken into account. The 
non-financial performance criteria further contribute to 
alignment with the sustainability agenda as well as Skanska’s 
purpose and values.
In addition to the financial targets outlined in Table 3 (a), the 
President and CEO has non-financial targets that may reduce 
the outcome of the variable cash remuneration. The outcome in 
relation to the financial targets determines the total (financial) bonus potential, i.e. the financial targets are the basis of the 
total bonus potential. This outcome may be reduced depending 
on the outcomes of the non-financial targets. The non-financial 
targets are set to support the Company’s business strategy and 
long-term value creation, including its sustainability   its sustainability agenda, 
and are for 2024 activity-based targets related to, among other 
things, Skanska’s climate target. The outcome is reduced in 
cases where the non-financial targets are not fully reached. 
The non-financial targets together represent 50 percent of 
the total bonus which means that the total bonus outcome 
may be reduced by up to 50 percent if the non-financial targets 
are not met. Information on Skanska’s climate target is available 
on pages 48–55 and 70–73 in the Annual and Sustainability 
Report 2024.
