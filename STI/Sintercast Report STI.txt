 The CEO participates in an annual and in a three -year cash -based incentive programme, similar to all other 
employees. During 2021, the Board approved a new three- year long- term incentive programme for all employees, 
including the CEO. Final incentive payments will only be granted to employees who are still employed by the

company on 1 August 2025. For the CEO , the programme provides a maximum amount corresponding to 33 percent 
of the outcome of the annual programme during 2022 and 40% during 2023 and 2024. Executive managers are 
obliged to buy SinterCast shares with 50 percent of the after tax monetary reward, and to hold the shares for at 
least 12 months.
