Comment on the development for 2024 
The table above shows the CEO and average 
employee remuneration, along with the Group’s 
 financial performance development from 2020 to 
2024. As can be seen, compared to the average 
employee remuneration, there is a higher variance 
in the CEO’s remuneration, as it is more influenced by variable components that depend on SKF’s 
 financial performance.
In 2024, the SKF financial performance is strong, 
though slightly softer compared to the previous year. 
This is reflected in the lower CEO remuneration for 
2024 compared to last year.
