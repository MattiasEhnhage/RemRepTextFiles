Total remuneration 42,119 45,008The remuneration of the Board of Directors in 2024 
was higher than the remuneration in 2023 due to

CEO Mikko Juhani Keto, and Group CFO Roland M. 
Andersen. 
The elements of the executive remuneration 
consist of a fixed cash-based salary, short-term-, 
long-term- and other incentives. Share based 
compensation (Long-term incentive programme) is 
included at fair value of incentives granted during 
2024. In the Annual report the cost is accrued over 
the vesting period of up to three years. Therefore, 
the executive remuneration as reported in Remu -
neration report cannot be directly compared to 
the executive remuneration in Annual report.

ation framework ensures the Company can attract 
and retain key executive profiles on competitive 
terms, while the incentive-based remuneration 
also encourages Group Executive Management to 
deliver results through strong strategy execution 
and value creation for shareholders.

motivate Group Executive Management to achieve
