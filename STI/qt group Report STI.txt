The remuneration of the CEO is considered as a whole, and it 
comprises both fixed and variable components. 
Fixed remuneration components include the fixed annual 
salary payable to the CEO under the CEO’s service contract. 
Holiday bonus and fringe benefits, if any, are considered to be 
part of this fixed monthly salary. 
The remuneration model includes two types of variable remu-
neration components: a cash bonus paid under the Company’s 
short-term incentive scheme and a reward paid in shares and/ 
or options (and, if applicable, in cash) under the Company’s 
long-term incentive scheme. 
The CEO has no supplementary pension scheme from the 
Company. 
The following , no bonus shall be paid.
Once the net sales target is reached, the President and CEO is 
paid an annual bonus amounting to 40 percent of his annual 
fixed salary. Between the minimum level and target level, the 
bonus is determined linearly between 0 and 100 percent, 
depending on actual performance.

as follows: 20 percent of each euro that exceeds the net sales 
target is used for the CEO’s and other company personnel's
