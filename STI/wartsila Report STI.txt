 ders that the most transparent means for comparing 
the development of remuneration over time, is to compare the CEO 
and Board’s remuneration with that of employees globally. Therefore, 
the figures shown for average employee remuneration are based on 
data for all Wärtsilä employees. In line with the Pay for Performance principle, a substantial part of 
the CEO’s remuneration is based on variable pay, i.e., short - and long -
term incentives. As our performance targets for short - and long -term 
incentives are linked to the business results, this development is 
reflected in the CEO’s remuneration. Employee remuneration is less 
volatile than that of the CEO, since a smaller portion of their total 
remuneration is based on variable pay elements. However, as all short -term incentive schemes are c onnected to the same 
performance indicators to a varying degree, employee remuneration 
is also impacted by Company performance.

The comparison figures show the remuneration paid out during each 
financial year. Pay -outs for the STI and LTI are always made during 
the year following the performance period. This means that, for 
example, remuneration figures presented for 202 4 are based on the 
STI performance period 202 3 and the LTI performance period of 
2021–2023. 
1.3. Any deviations or clawbacks made 
No deviations from the Remuneration Policy were made during 202 4 
and the Company has not exercised any rights to reclaim or cancel 
any paid or unpaid incentives.
