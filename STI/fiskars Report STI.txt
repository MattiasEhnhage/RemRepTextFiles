 al year was 
executed in accordance with the Remuneration Policy. 
There has been no deviation from the Policy, and 
no remuneration of the CEO or the Board has been 
reclaimed or restated during 2024.
Our remuneration principles
The total compensation of the Board members, 
consisting of their annual remuneration and meeting 
fees, is defined to attract and retain qualified and 
high-caliber Board members and to fairly compensate 
them in line with the complexity and nature of the 
Company’s business. The role of the Board is to set Fiskars Group’s strategy and long-term targets and to 
monitor their implementation.
The key principles applied to the CEO and Deputy 
to the CEO’s remuneration are a strong emphasis 
on pay-for-performance, a competitive earning 
opportunity, and a focus on shareholder value 
creation by aligning their interests with those of 
the shareholders. The variable performance-based 
short-term and long-term incentives form the largest 
element of remuneration, t on emphasize 
pay-for-performance and the achievement of the 
Company’s short- and long-term goals, and they 
form a significant portion of the remuneration of the 
President and CEO. Share-based rewards, share 
ownership plans and the requirement to retain at least 
50% of the net shares received from the share-based 
incentive plans until the CEO’s share ownership in 
Fiskars corresponds to at least 100% of annual gross 
base salary align the interests of the President and 
CEO with those of the Company’s shareholders.
The figures in the table are presented on a cash 
basis. The remuneration of the President and CEO is 
presented on an accrual basis in note 6.2 to Fiskars
