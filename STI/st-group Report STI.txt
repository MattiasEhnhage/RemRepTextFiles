REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT
5.1 REMUNERATION POLICY SUMMARY
Members of the Executive Management receive a 
total compensation package which is designed to 
align with the Company’s strategy and suitably reflect 
shareholders’ interests. It consists of a fixed annual 
base salar nked to business performance. The 
short-term incentive gives focus to the Company’s 
annual priorities and is intended to contribute to the 
execution of strategy. The long-term incentive links the 
reward of the Executive Management with performance 
of the organisation on a longer-term time horizon, 
taking into consideration the Company’s long-term sustainability. The long-term incentive is also designed 
to strengthen the executives’ retention through the 
issue of annual rolling grants which are performance 
based. Shares in the Company are awarded which aims 
to ensure a high degree of alignment of the executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders. Remuneration can be clawed back for reasons of 
material and manifest misstatement of data or accounts, 
miscalculation or other error, or bad faith. The Board 
of Directors also has the right to make proportionate 
adjustments by offsetting other forms of remuneration, 
including salary, bonuses yet to be paid and unvested 
PSUs  changes in the composition of the 
Executive Management during the year.
5.3 ANNUAL BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS
The annual base salaries of the CEO and the CFO 
were reviewed during the year in accordance with the 
principles and process contained in the Remuneration 
Policy. The effective date of the normal annual review 
cycle is 1 January to align with the performance cycle 
of the incentive programmes and the financial year of 
the Company.
The CEO’s annual base salary increased by 3.5% (3.5% 
in 2023) and the CFO’s annual base salary increased by 
3.5% (3.5% in 2023), aligned with the salary increase 
budget awarded to the Company’s employees in 
Denmark.
5.4 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMME
For 2024, the Short-term Incentive Programme’s (“STIP”) 
three key performance indicators (“KPIs”) were (1) 
Group Reported Net Sales, (2) Group EBITDA Margin 
before special items and (3) Group Free Cash Flow before 
acquisitions and special items. These KPIs were selected 
by the Board of Directo the Board of Directors for their relevance to annual 
profit and cash management performance as well as to 
the achievement of the Company’s strategy to become 
a bigger company. The maximum bonus payment that the CEO and the CFO could have earned under the STIP 
was 60% of annual base salary. An on-target level of 
performance would have awarded a bonus payment 
of 30% of annual base salary. The Board of Directors 
determined that the performance of the KPIs had been 
achieved as summarised in Table 5. Accordingly, the CEO 
and CFO both achieved a bonus award of 44.3% of their 
respective annual base salaries, which is well within the 
maximum of the Remuneration Policy.
5.5 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMME
Under the Long-term Incentive Programme (“L TIP”), the 
CEO and CFO receive an annual grant of Performance 
Share Units (“PSUs”). No payment is due from the 
executives for the grant of a PSU. The size of their PSU 
grant is based on a percentage of their current annual 
base salary d nnual 
base salary divided by the grant price (“Grant Price”). 
The Grant Price is normally the average price of the 
Company’s shares calculated over the ten trading days 
following the publication of the Company’s annual 
report in the grant year. The value of PSUs granted 
to an executive at the time of grant will not exceed 
100% of the annual base salary then applicable, even 
assuming a maximum level of performance under 
the L TIP .TABLE 5. PERFORMANCE OF THE STIP 2024

The grants were based on salaries as at 1 May 2022. 
The executives were granted additional dividend 
PSUs equivalent to the dividends distributed to the 
Company’s shareholders during the performance period.
Following the end of the 2024 financial year, the Board 
of Directors determined that the performance of the 
KPIs had been achieved as summarized in Table 7, with 
historical L TIP performance provided for context in 
Table 8. The Board of Directors applied a performance 
multiplier to the executives’ PSU awards granted under 
the 2022-2024 L TIP cycle, and 15% of these will vest in 
April 2025 as shown in Table 9.
2024-2026 performance cycle
In 2024, members of the Executive Management were 
awarded PSUs subject to the fulfilment of four KPIs; 
EBITDA margin, ROIC growth, Adjusted EPS growth, 
and Sustainability, measured over a three-year 
performance period from 2024 to 2026. The Board 
of Directors considers these KPIs to be core success 
measures in supporting  ry
