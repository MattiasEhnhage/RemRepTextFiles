STI remuneration for the CEO 2024
The STI program has been measured during the 
full year 2024 and is capped at 75 percent of the 
fixed salary 2024 . The performance criteria for 
the CEO’s STI consist of 100% Group objectives.
There are three Group objectives that are 
measured against predetermined threshold 
levels; 1) EBITDA margin compared to peer 
group1), 2) Operating cash flow in relation to 
adjusted operating result before depreciation and 
amortization, and 3) A sustainability objective 
measuring the injury frequency with lost time 
which lead to absence of more than one day 
(LTIF). 
The STI objectives have been designed to 
contribute to the company’s business strategy 
and long-term interests, including its 
sustainability, by be ustainability, by being clearly linked to the 
business strategy and increased value creation 
for the company.
A prerequisite for STI payment is that the Group 
shows a positive adjusted operating result 
(excluding items affecting comparability). This 
threshold was reached for 2024 and the STI 
outcome is distributed as follows. 1) SSAB’s 
EBITDA margin exceeded the peer group’s 
average EBITDA margin by 5.7 percentage points, 
which provides maximum payout. 2) The 
Operating cash flow in relation to adjusted 
operating result objective reached 89 percent, 
which provides 95 percent payout. 3) The 
accident frequency (LTIF) was measured at 0.75, 
and provides a maximum payout.
