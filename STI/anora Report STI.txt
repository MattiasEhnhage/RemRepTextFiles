 agenda, and strategy 
implementation are rewarded with 
short- and long-term incentives. On 9 June 2022, the Board 
of Directors decided on the 
establishment of a share-based 
long-term incentive program for 
the company’s management and 
selected key employees. The program 
consists of individual three-year 
plans which begin annually. During 
2024, Anora’s CEO participated in two 
earning periods in the share-based 
program: 2023-2025 and 2024-2026.
These performance-based share 
plans return a share reward based 
on four performance measures: 
1) revenue growth (35% weight); 2) 
earnings per share (35% weight); 3) 
relative total shareholder return (20% 
weight); and 4) environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) measure (10% 
weight). The ESG measure is the ESG 
risk rating by Sustainalytics achieved 
by the end of 2025 and 2026.
