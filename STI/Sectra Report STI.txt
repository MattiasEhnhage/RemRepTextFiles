They should also consist of individually adapted quantitativ e or qualitative goals. The criteria are to be designed to 
promote the company’s business strategy and long-term intere sts, including its sustainability. In addition to variable 
remuneration that executives may receive in accordance with these guidelines, the Board of Directors may decide that 
such executives could be covered by programs for variable remuneration that also cover personnel categories other than senior executives such as all employees in the Group or in a particular business area. Such programs must entitle all 
employees (regardless of position) to the possibility of the same nominal remuneration. The complete guidelines are 
presented on pages 71–72 of the company’s Annual Report and Sustainability Report for 2023/2024.

selection of performance criteria. The non-financial performance criteria also contribute to the adaptation to sustainability as well as the company’s values. All perform ance criteria have been met for 2023/2024 and 2022/2023.
