apply to the financial year, but can in exceptional cases be linked to targets, 
which extend over a longer period of time.
The maximum cash bonus that can be achieved corresponds to twelve months’ 
base wage. 
The performance criteria applied for 2024 and the level of achievement are 
explained in table 6.
50% of the payment of the cash bonus has been deferred for three years, 
converting the bonus into restricted stock units (RSUs). At the same time, the 
members of the Executive Management will receive a premium of 50% of the 
deferred bonus by grant of additional RSUs free of charge on expiry of the 
three years (so-called "matching shares").Table 6 - Performance criteria and applicable short-term incentive remuneration in 2024
