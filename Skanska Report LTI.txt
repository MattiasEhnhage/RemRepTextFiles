 account. The amount included for 2024 in the table is the 
maximum outcome for 2024. The variable cash remuneration agreement includes a general clause stipulating that the Board and the Compensation Committee are entitled to wholly or partly 
reduce the variable cash remuneration. The one-year variable cash remuneration for the President and CEO may amount to not more than 75 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. The amount

5 The value stated for 2024 refers to a preliminary award of performance shares for 2024’s invested saving shares, calculated based on the share price on December 30, 2024 (SEK 232.70). The 
 President and CEO is preliminarily estimated to receive 6,521 performance shares. The Board will determine the final outcome for 2024 after reviewing the operational performance in the first 
 quarter of 2025. In order to receive performance shares, an additional three years of servi ld, and employment must 
continue. Vesting of performance shares is also subject to the 
satisfaction of a number of performance conditions. The 
performance conditions used to assess the outcome of Seop 5 
and Seop 6 consist of financial targets at Group, business unit 
and/or business unit cluster level. The financial target 
applicable at Group level, which applies for the President and 
CEO and the other members of the Group Leadership Team, is growth in earnings per share (EPS target). In Seop 6, the 
performance conditions applicable at Group level also contain 
a climate target linked to the Group’s reduction of carbon 
emissions within scope 1 and scope 2 (Climate target), which 
applies for the President and CEO and the other members of 
the Group Leadership Team in addition to the EPS target. The 
weighting of the performance conditions and the 2024 
preliminary outcome of the EPS target and Climate target can 
be found in Table 3 (b). Information on the starting point and 
o rmally be vested only after the lock-up period for each annual program, which comprises three years. Vesting of matching shares and/or 
 performance shares to participants within each annual program is estimated to occur monthly three years after the investment in each saving share, meaning that vesting of matching shares and 
performance shares under Seop 5 is estimated to occur monthly during the financial year 2023 in respect of the annual program 2020, during the financial year 2024 in respect of the annual 
program 2021 and during the financial year 2025 in respect of the annual program 2022. Vesting of performance shares under Seop 6 is estimated to occur monthly during the financial year 2026 in 
respect of the annual program 2023, during the financial year 2027 in respect of the annual program 2024, and during the financial year 2028 in respect of the annual program 2025.
